use cases: tunnels, highways, city roads, or any site where rapid incident detection is crucialespecially locations where delayed response e.g., due to smoke or fire in a tunnel can be particularly dangerous.
core technology: advanced ai deep neural networks and computer vision that recognizes, tracks, and classifies all objects and events in the video scene.how the detection works 1. video input the system can work with any ip camera feed including thermal, ptz, panoramic, or fixed security cameras via rtsp or other standard video streams.
each cameras feed is analyzed either on-edge in the camera if it has the required ai processor or by a separate embedded device server running the flow software.
2. ai-based object tracking every moving or stationary object is detected and tracked frame by frame.
vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, animals, or other objects are classified in real time up to 17 different categories .
the system uses trajectory-based analysiseach objects precise path, speed, and other attributes are monitored continuously.
3. incident definitions rules users define what constitutes an incident by setting up rules for instance, stationary vehicle in lane, fallen object detected, pedestrian in restricted area, fire smoke visible, etc.
.
these rules are configured within the flow framework via a visual programming interface, so operators can easily set up or adjust detection conditions without deep programming knowledge.
4. real-time alerting when the software detects an incident e.g., stalled vehicle, wrong-way driver, or smoke , it immediately triggers alerts to operators.
alerts can include text notifications, on-screen messages, emails, or automatic triggers to external systems e.g., variable message signs, control center dashboards .
5. data sharing integration the platform offers open apis rest, udp, webhooks plus optional hardware interfaces e.g., relay outputs, sdlc, ntcip for integrating with: traffic management systems tms .
video management systems vms .
tunnel or highway supervisory control and data acquisition scada .
smart city dashboards or third-party software.
this integration ensures automated coordination: for example, sending an alert to a tunnels ventilation system if smoke is detected, or activating emergency signage on a highway.technical highlights local edge or server-based processing on-edge: the flow analytics run directly on compatible cameras or a small ai unit near the camera.
server-side: multiple camera feeds can also be centralized on an on-premise server running flow enterprise, which can handle large-scale aid across entire networks.
non-intrusive setup uses existing camerasno need to install physical sensors in road surfaces.
the system can be added to existing cctv infrastructure or quickly deployed in new projects.
continuous multi-event detection many detection tasks run simultaneouslyfor example, identifying a fallen object, detecting a vehicle driving in the wrong direction, and spotting smoke at the same time, all from a single camera feed.
high accuracy speed ai-driven approach reduces false alarms compared to simple pixel-based motion detection.
frame-by-frame tracking of each object helps confirm actual incidents and reduce detection times.
flexible alert configuration alerts notifications can be sent within milliseconds depending on the local network .
operators can customize severity levels and escalations, e.g., fire detection vs. vehicle stopped.
scalability from a single camera in one tunnel to hundreds of cameras citywide.
the same ai framework can also handle traffic data collection, safety analysis near misses , and adaptive control of traffic lightsaid is simply one of the module sets in the flow platform.example aid scenario tunnel monitoring 1. camera feed cameras are installed at regular intervals inside a tunnel.
2. continuous ai analysis flow monitors each camera feed in real time, identifying objects, vehicles, and environmental factors e.g., smoke .
3. rule definition operators configure rules: if a vehicle remains motionless for 10 seconds, if an unknown object appears, if smoke fog density surpasses a threshold, etc.
4. alert trigger on detecting a rule violation e.g., a stopped car or smoke , flow immediately sends an alert to the control room.
it can also update the tunnels variable message signs e.g., lane closed .
5. response operators dispatch emergency services if needed, or close the tunnel section.
event is time-stamped and logged for further analysis.key takeaways camera-based: aid is fully video-based, leveraging ai and computer vision.
real-time: incidents are flagged within seconds for quick operator response.
highly configurable: users visually program the detection logic in flows interface, tailoring it to local needs.
open integration: communicates with third-party systems traffic signals, digital signage, scada to automate responses.
scalable modular: suitable for anything from a single tunnel section to a major highway network or citywide deployment.
in short, datafromskys aid solution employs deep-learning video analytics the flow framework to continuously watch forand instantly respond tocritical traffic incidents, making roads and tunnels safer while reducing response times.
overview of automated incident detection in flow flow is a comprehensive platform for the analysis of traffic movements based on our proprietary ai, machine learning, and trajectory-based approach.
its easy to configure, it runs in real-time and it can talk to other devices and systems.
people counting, traffic analyses, adaptive traffic lights, parking management, incident detection, perimeter protection, crowd managementyou name the application.
you can create infrastructure sensors for smart city applications easily, in a single environment.
thanks to trajectory data flow is uniquely equipped with wrong-way driving detection, illegal lane change, and u-turn detection that are impossible to detect with most systems.
it can also detect blocking vehicles, perimeter breach, and other unwanted behavior.
our algorithms detect individual moving and static traffic participants with all physical aspects of their presence on the scene, like their positions, object category, colors, and trajectories.
there is a wide variety of traffic data types which we are capable of collecting from the video, including passage time, gap time, time to follow, speed, and more.
with its trajectory-based tracking, you are able to get all the data on an object before it causes or becomes part of an incident.core technology and real-time processing flow is a real-time monitoring solution that can be deployed on: smart cameras trafficcamera embedded units trafficembedded or trafficxroads servers trafficenterprise in all these deployments, flow runs an advanced deep neural network dnn for object detection and tracking, classifying objects in up to 19 categories e.g. 
car, heavy vehicle, bus, motorcycle, pedestrian .
each object is tracked continuously to form a trajectory over time.
these trajectories are then examined by an array of operators and filters zone filters, time-of-occurrence filters, speed or acceleration filters, etc.
to determine whether an incident or abnormal event has happened.
flow can also be integrated with drone feeds in real time trafficdrone .
in all use cases, once the system registers a suspicious or dangerous event, it can raise an immediate alert and pass it to traffic operators or 3rd party software or hardware via: open api rest or webhooks i o modules digital outputs to trigger physical signals or devices sdlc direct interface to traffic light controllers defining and detecting incidents stationary or blocking vehicles flow can detect stationary vehicles in specific locations shoulders, no-parking lanes, or intersection boxes .
it measures stationary time and, if it exceeds a set threshold, triggers an alert.
example: stopping the car on the shoulder or in the middle of the road does not only influence traffic flow negatively, but it can also be dangerous.
if such a situation happens, its important to detect it immediately.
flow can detect stationary vehicles, measure the duration of blocking, and send real-time notifications.
wrong-way driving flow tracks each vehicles position and direction.
by drawing gates or movements on the roadway and configuring the allowed direction, the system flags trajectories that go against traffic flow.
example: wrong-way driving can be prevented using notifications and led panels.
this is possible with the power of flow which comes in many forms suitable for different uses.
u-turns and illegal maneuvers flow can detect u-turns or other prohibited turns by setting directional movement filters.
if an objects trajectory forms a u-shaped path through designated gates, flow registers a u-turn event.
congestion or traffic jam detection flow measures speed, occupancy, and passage times or level of service, los .
low speed or high occupancy triggers traffic congestion alerts.
traffic jam detection can be integrated with overhead message boards or used for adaptive signal timing.
near collisions and safety events flow can run a safety analysis in real-time, detecting: time to collision ttc post encroachment time pet heavy braking these metrics indicate imminent or likely collisions, giving an early warning of hazardous events.
our safety analysis identifies dangerous driving behavior and detects accidents before they happen.
we measure time to collision, heavy braking, post-encroachment time, and more.how incident detection works internally 1. video input object detection flow ingests a camera feed rtsp stream or drone feed.
a deep neural network detects objects frame by frame car, van, bus, pedestrian, etc.
.
2. trajectory tracking for each detected object, flows tracking engine builds a continuous trajectory in both space and time.
short occlusions can be bridged automatically.
3. operators filters the user sets zones, gates, or movements in the interface to define the monitored areas and intended traffic paths.
then filters speed, direction, stationary-time, etc.
pick out anomalies or incidents.
4. event trigger once a trajectory violates a rulee.g., driving in reverse direction, stopping on a shoulder, or having a dangerously short time-to-collisionflow raises an internal event.
5. real-time alert or control action events can be forwarded instantly via: rest or webhooks to 3rd-party software e.g., to show warnings on a city platform i o relays for physical triggers e.g.
switching traffic signals, triggering sirens sdlc for direct integration with traffic controllers.example aid tasks shoulder blocking detection: a zone filter stationary duration motion filter instantly flags a stalled or parked car where it should not be.
wrong-way detection: a movement filter from an exit gate to an entry gate.
if a vehicle crosses them in reverse order, it triggers an incident event.
congestion detection: time-based or speed-based thresholds that measure average travel speed or occupancy across a zone.
slowing to near-standstill triggers a traffic jam alarm.
stop-sign violation: a zone behind the stop sign combined with a minimal stationary-time filter.
if a vehicles stationarity is below 1 second, it is flagged.
near collision crash: real-time time-to-collision or heavy braking detection.
if an extreme deceleration or dangerously short ttc is detected, it logs or alerts an incident.visual programming configuration to create an aid rule in flow, you use a drag-and-drop canvas of operators: spatial filters zones, gates, movements motion filters speed, acceleration, stationary time, etc.
property filters vehicle category, license plates set operations union, intersection, complement .
by chaining these operators, you specify an incident condition.
for instance, a gate reverse direction movement filter wrong-way.
or a zone stationary duration filter 20 seconds blocked lane.
once the condition is met, the system raises a real-time alert.integration alerts flow can exchange data via: rest sinks: polled requests from third-party software webhook: automatic push of event data udp sinks: broadcasting real-time events for minimal-latency integration sdlc: communication with intersection traffic controllers i o modules: switching relays, turning on flashing lights or signage example: we will connect flow to an intelligent highway infrastructure to close the road section immediately.
just take the udp zone sink and drop it on the wrong-way driving movement instance this way, flow will push a message to the adaptive traffic sign controller only milliseconds after it has detected the predefined motion.key points for aid in flow 1. real-time edge-ready flow processes video data on edge devices smart cameras or embedded boxes or servers, with typical detection latency in the range of 200300 ms. 2. trajectory-based detection the entire incident logic relies on robust, per-object trajectory tracking rather than single-frame triggers.
this approach yields fewer false positives, more contextual detail, and immediate incident awareness.
3. highly configurable rules users visually define incident logic, covering a wide range of scenarios: stationary, jam, wrong-way, collisions, perimeter intrusion, or custom rules.
4. instant output incidents produce immediate events that can drive led signs, alarms, or be fed into city platforms for automated responses.
5. scalability the same aid platform can handle one camera or hundreds in parallel trafficenterprise .
with flow, you can gather u-turn violation statistics or real-time alerts for wrong-way drivers.
flows real-time responsiveness and easy device connectivity with open api or i o interfaces make it ideal for traffic control, stop sign compliance, or wrong-way driving deterrence.

for many cities all around the world, parking is a major source of revenue but also a primary cause of traffic congestion and sometimes a true nightmare for drivers.
in the last few years, many smart parking solutions have been conceived and some of them implemented, such as embedded sensors in the ground that relay to a smartphone when a parking space is available.
but instead of tearing up the asphalt to build in these costly sensors, what if cities used drones to monitor parking availability?

these there are many crossroads where fixed traffic signaling does not match the changing composition of traffic.
suboptimal and poorly executed traffic management leads to traffic jams and driver discomfort.
furthermore it drastically increases emissions and noise and also increases the risk of a traffic accident.
this was no different at the t junction in the zlin city where due to the construction of a new shopping center, the traffic demand rapidly increased and became a lot less predictable.
due to this, the installation of sensors for adaptive traffic control was supported to go ahead under the following conditions: september 14, 2015 traffic research, traffic statistics, research project, research, tu dresden, traffic analysis, dataset, datafromsky, traffic dataset, traffic data, trajectory dataset, traffic, drone traffic dataset, traffic engineering, drone traffic data, traffic study, ai, vehicle classification, trafficsurvey, artificialintelligence, computervision, trafficcamera durability traffic data, traffic, ai, artificialintelligence, computervision, traffic statistics, video analytics, actuated traffic control, traffic jam data, intertraffic, 360 camera, quad view camera, 360 traffic camera, flow, drone traffic camera, traffic monitoring, datafromsky create customized dashboards optimized for your traffic tasks using various widgets.

url: trafficxroads together with cameras is very easy to deploy to existing crossroads and allows to upgrade them with adaptive traffic control capabilities.
the traffic engineer responsible for the project required the detection of vehicles at the minimum distance of 50 meters in every direction.
there was no cabling between the traffic controller and the individual traffic light poles that had only permanent power supply.
because of this all the data communication was done wirelessly.
on each of the traffic light poles one full hd ip camera with wdr technology was installed; in total 3 cameras.
the trafficxroads unit was installed inside the case of the traffic controller and was connected to the ctonroller via an utp cable.
the hardware installation took 3 hours including the verification of the communication and the correct functioning and was done without the need to stop the traffic.

the dynamic control of traffic has almost halved the waiting time in comparison to the previously used fixed traffic signaling.
thanks to the system detecting cars up to 80 meters, the number of vehicles having to stop at the intersection has reduced 1.7x times.
this has a positive effect on the reduction of the local noise and emission levels.
this solution was installed and configured in just a single morning and there was no need to stop the traffic.
this solution is considerably cheaper in comparison to other technologies.

new flow feature notifications installation without having to stop traffic trafficxroads is one of the flagship devices running the flow video analytics system.
it is an embedded unit that can process up to 6 camera streams on the edge.
there are already completed installations in texas and virginia, and multiple pocs in progress across the usa.
this product has many benefits and is well suited for intersection detection, and traffic control input for daily operations coupled with traffic data collection as well as signal performance measures spm input for planners.
it is easy to do an initial proof of concept to reduce the time to installation and verification with trafficxroads as it can be usually done quite quickly using existing ip camera streams.
this reduces the delays associated with construction, road closure or other labor-intensive measures associated with testing a new system for approval.
many agencies take direct feeds from their video management systems vms remotely in tmc signal shop office space without the need to go to remote cabinets.
the trafficxroads can then be fully configured, tested, and verified prior to moving it to a field location for connection to a controller.
if data collection only is required, the same remote data feeds can be supplied to trafficxroads on a planners desk aggregated to 48-hour or 72-hour counts without interrupting operations to collect data.
smart sensors can also be dual purpose.
the highly accurate flow analytics improve not only object detection in all types of weather, they provide non-embedded classification of both motor vehicles and expanded classes of active mobility road users.
traffic operations requirements to accurately provide detections to the controller come hand in hand with the improved ability to report a rich data set of the objects characteristics while it passes within a camera field of view.
in the case of flow video analytics edge devices, this means the real-time data is fed directly to traffic controllers via ntcip or open api via a network connection, in addition to classic sdlc or i 0 directly.
simultaneously, the long-term traffic counts and various other traffic statistics are continuously being updated on servers, smart city platforms, traffic control center devices, and other systems that require this data.
this happens thanks to the edge devices being directly connected to the citys network via ethernet, wifi, or lte .

what are the current views on video analytics using the new generation of traffic sensing and data processing technology?
to answer that we need to recall the past.
legacy technology for the past 30 years has driven much of definition of what is required for compatibility while limiting what is possible as a result.
for data collection, one legacy requirement of them is the approach to data storage.
until now, because of limited choices for communications options, these organizations required a full year of onboard data storage on the specific traffic monitoring edge device.
new iot technology has much better connectivity, allowing cities rapidly deploy devices and collect smart city data on updated aggregation platforms.
these faster, real-time connections help to reduce latency, improve the data download and availability, and reduce the need for long periods between login and retrieval as well as improved aggregation and display of information.

object density visualizes the density of occurring objects.
the contrast polygon should be placed in a position with high and constant contrast no matter the time of day.
to achieve a high contrast it is necessary that the bright area of the footage corresponds to the dark area.
the position of the contrast indicator should be at a distance where visibility is still necessary with respect to the possibilities of the actual camera view.
in scenes with unnatural lighting, we can use the horizontal road marking.
the indicator automatically does not evaluate contrast in situations when there is a traffic object present in its defined area that causes the contrast to change artificially.
when configuring the actual contrast in the zone the current contrast is indicated by the current contrast but be aware that it does not filter out traffic objects.

we have multiple solutions for real-time processing.
first is the trafficcamera unit and second is the trafficembedded which can manage up to 6 smart cameras both of these use edge computing .
the last is the trafficenterprise which is server based solution and can be used for one traffic framework covering a large area.
for more on flow and the products that run it see the introduction to flow webinar or the webinar summary.
traffic regions are mostly used to define stationary vehicles in a certain area in the scene view, but you can get other information such as average speed or average acceleration of each object within the traffic region.
you can set your own virtual traffic region in the video and you can move it or change it any time you want.
you can use the possibility to export all the traffic data to .csv file for further analysis as well.
use the start download option if you have the right to install it on your computer.
alternatively, you can download the portable version of flow by clicking on the download portable version" button.
if you have any device that can be turned on and off or otherwise operated by switching the electric current in its wires, we have good news for you: any device from the flow family can operate it too!
this includes embedded units, smart cameras, servers and more.
all that is thanks to the addition of input output interfaces.
with them, you'll be able to do things like: license plate recognition - anpr, lpr, npr, alpr the imported settings must originate from a flow block version that is lower or the same as the block's current version.

live view of mjpeg stream on dashboard prior to the covid-19 outbreak now there's nothing left to do but wait for the data collection.
our algorithms will detect individual moving and static traffic participants with all physical aspects of their presence on the scene, like their positions, object category, colors, and trajectories.
there is a wide variety of traffic data types which we are capable to collect from the video, including passage time, gap time, time to follow, speed, and many more features.
a: with flow version 1.13 or higher installed, the unit can analyze up to 6 camera streams at 15 fps.
it is possible to connect any camera to the unit that provides rtsp stream h264 h265.
the current video-analytical engine is not optimized for fisheye cameras high distortion cameras .
we recommend cameras with technology for the improvement of the night image quality for example the axis p1455-le 3-9mm with the light finder technology.
first, we drag and drop a category filter to the canvas.
we double-click it to open its menu and we tick boxes to select the following categories: car, light, heavy, bus, and motorcycle as shown in the picture below.
we do this because we want the filter to only react to motorized vehicles.
how do categories fit classes according to different classifications?
new languages have been added to flow - portuguese brazilian and romanian moldavian .
live view can now also be shown on the dashboard as seen in the scripting gif above with your pre-defined settings - allowing you to change what is being visualized from the flag display settings options as well as the fps, image scale, and jpeg compression rate.

under source of events select the table widget we have created.
in the image evidence section click on the new image data and add the two gates we have selected for visual evidence gathering.
in the protocol attributes part you can set the thresholds for gap time and speed.
if the given object will go over them, they will be highlighted in the report.
now you are generating .xlsx section speed evidence reports!
you can access and download them in the storage section of the given analytics.
you can combine this feature with safety analysis to visualize the distance between objects not only in seconds but in meters or feet as well.
url: the high-quality detection of parking detection is ensured with our flow analytics that provide data to the parkingdetection platform using api.
flow is a universal solution allowing you to detect almost anything you need from real-time video streams.
it can be used not only for parking but also for traffic, retail, and security.
it powers detection in single smart trafficcameras, local trafficembedded units supporting up to 6 cameras or any number of cameras with the centralized trafficenteprise which is capable of utilizing existing camera infrastructure.
this lets you define a time window for the predictive filtering algorithm to refine trajectories.
a shorter period reduces latency and is ideal for time-critical applications, while a longer time frame results in smooth and continuous trajectories even when traffic objects pass behind obstacles.
the lower the value the faster response.
100 ms can be set for super-fast response times which are needed for example when turning on light signs to prevent wrong-way driving.
the default value is 2000 ms and it is better to leave it there for higher quality results that are not needed super fast.
once the camera starts moving, you can consider the trajectories that were tracked up to that point to be closed.
to be more precise, the trajectories are interrupted and won't continue, but they'll be formally closed after a five-minute period.
this somewhat limits the possible use casesfor example, a ptz camera watching a parking lot would consider cars parked for a long time to be new traffic objects and trajectories each time it moves away and back to its home position.
example picture where lpr is possible.
ideally, the camera should be higher than this.

we can count the number of accidents, but we don't usually have detailed information on the risky situations which - fortunately - didn't end up with a collision.
we have prepared a webinar with a guest speaker line degn landen from our partner cowi, where we will be speaking about how to detect dangerous situations on our roads using automated video analytics.
furthermore, we will look into areas of road safety analysis such as aggressive driver behavior, offensive lane change, collision-prone location identification, short following distances, or speeding.
we will also explain the linear and the ackerman steering model movement prediction and how they are utilized in traffic safety and we will also look at what to detect and measure when analyzing road safety, looking at trajectories, time to collision, and post encroachment time in trafficsurvey viewer, our tool for traffic studies.

example of using speed motion filter with 2 movements one for each direction display distance of an object from others based on your requirements, measure distance within the video, or add a note label directly to the video.
you can export all these features to video or snapshot export as well.
in our example, we filter this pool of trajectories in 2 ways.
we filter them based on categories and spatial properties of the trajectory.
to filter the trajectories to only get the ones that have passed through the whole section and count only the trajectory parts in the area we want to monitor, we need to create a movement spatial filter.
to define the movement we need to create 2 gates - one at the start and one at the end of the road section and then we need to connect them.
afterward, we drag the movement over to the canvas and connect it to the category filter.

how to set up communication with the quido i o interface object classification in flow block settings everything seems to be okay.
the only thing left to do before leaving the survey to collect data is to check the analytic settings, which are explained in-depth here.
in general, you'll want to pay attention at least to the autosave settings, but other settings can also be useful for your specific scene or use case.
statistical value widget autorecover, autosave and autoreboot to have a better overview of the situation we can add a distribution, trajectory view, and table widgets to the category filter in the canvas.
we can then monitor the situation using the dashboard tab where we can see the number of shoulder parked vehicles detected as well as the current situation on camera.
analyst - this user is able to manipulate the analytics they have access to.
it means that they can define the traffic tasks, dashboards and use data sinks.
analysts cannot access user management and device interface settings i.e.

note that is it possible to connect to multiple flow devices with single ip using port forwarding.
it is necessary to specify two ports when accessing the devices this way, the flow block - 8088 for transfer of traffic data and flow node - 5556 for image data transfer .
when logging into the device in flow insights, type your ip address and ports in the following format ip : port block : port node as shown in the example below.
to learn more about ports read this article.
we also need to tick now under the time mode of the zone.
this is needed to count only currently present shoulder parked vehicles instead of vehicles detected over time.

lens distortion can be another issue.
be wary of cameras with heavy lens distortion, like fisheye cameras for which the speed measurements will be inaccurate everywhere but around the center of the camera video feed.
from flow version 1.17 there are 3 types of views above the video analytics level.
the tile view, the map view, and the list view.
the map view visualizes the analytics into a map showing them on their respective location.
for this to work two conditions need to be fulfilled.
first, the analytic s needs to have the camera location field filled in.
second, you need to have a map data api key set up and saved either in your flow insights desktop application or in the device you are connecting to see the analytics in the map view.

flow storage is a device-independent local space for storing any type of traffic data produced by the analytics.
this is a new form of storing traffic data but also parking, retail or security data.
each defined analytics has its own storage, but the total capacity is shared among the individual cameras analytics and the actual size depends on the specific flow device.
the storage size can be adjusted based on customers' needs.
for straightforward data management and easy use, flow storage has a flat structure with a grouping feature.
a group is an abstract entity representing a set of stored objects which are somehow related.
for example, a group can be an image and csv file and any other additional information related to the individual case of a traffic violation.

the fps divider is directly related to the computation tick interval cti mentioned in the next section.
if the cti is set to 100 ms, the detector analyzes 10 frames per second and sends them to flow insights.
if you reduce this number with the fps divider, the video images will be sent to flow insights with reduced frequency, but it doesn't influence how many fps the detector actually processes.
here are some example values: this webinar discusses the benefits of trafficsurvey using video analysis and then a guest presents details of their traffic study.

a visually pleasing environment that perfectly matches the features and philosophy of the flow system.
finally, let's focus on the confidence settings.
detector confidence is not as straightforward as it might seemdon't presume that passing only detections with high confidence will get you good results.
even the lower-confidence detections are important.
to use this setting safely, first, observe the scene and try to determine the average confidence of the traffic objects in it.
to see the confidence, go to the analytics camera view and enable its display in the bottom left corner.
you'll then see the score on each object's flag.
in terms of accuracy of vehicle localization, the ideal camera position is directly above the analysed intersection the so-called nadir or top-down view.
at this position, the camera is the most sensitive to position changes of objects in the scene.
at the same time, dynamic occlusions between individual objects are minimized.
unfortunately, drone flight above a traffic node is not always possible due to safety regulations and applicable legislation.
in a situation like this, a simple rule applies go as close and as high as possible.
udp sinks now you know how to detect u-turns with flow.
we offer multiple real-time solutions that run flow, each suitable for different use.
one of them is the plug n play smart trafficcamera which is perfect for simple scenarios similar to the one in our u-turn video.
for more complex traffic scenes, there is the trafficembedded which can run up to 6 cameras.
you can also use any number of existing city cameras with our on-premise trafficenterprise solution and detect u-turns across the whole city.
with flow you can gather u-turn violation statistics that can be an important safety indicator for a given intersection.
flows real-time responsiveness and easy device connectivity with public api or i o interfaces make it ideal for traffic control, stop sign compliance or wrong-way driving deterrence.
though the modern drones are super stable, it is still not possible to record longer aerial videos in the exact same viewpoint and digital stabilization is required all tiny camera movements are multiplied with the distance - this is the physics .
therefore, the sophisticated digital stabilization must be and is an integral part of datafromsky aerial.
for that reason, our outputs are robust to small movements of uav drone during the recording caused by wind, operator, etc.
the stabilization is also needed if you want to get super precise vehicle positions, speeds, accelerations for advanced traffic analysis such as safety analysis or capacity estimation.
you can use static anonymization together with the dynamic one.

a: there are multiple benefits.
the camera loses accuracy with distance while the drone provides accurate coverage of the same and even bigger area compared to static cameras thanks to the top-view.
getting distance related data such as gap times or speeds can be done with very good precision with a drone compared to a camera.
and most importantly, it is a super mobile solution deployable in a minute if needed, allowing you to see but not be seen.
the rolling menus in the lower-left corner let you choose what you want to see in the video view: we have an extensive help section with many articles and videos to help you understand how flow insights works.
you can use the search bar on the top right of the help section to find what you are looking for.
below you can see a list of the most important guides to help you get started with flow.
download flow demokit the trajectory indicator zone should be placed at a position where the trajectory lengths are the same for all objects of interest regardless of direction .
in other words, the dispersion of lengths is very low under normal visibility for the selected object categories.
it should also be placed in a high-traffic position because it is better to prioritize this indicator over the contrast indicator.
the minimum average length is defined in pixels and you can use the ruler tool to easily get the value place the ruler in the position of the average trajectory in the zone .
it is good to subtract approx.
5 of the length for a reserve.
most ptz cameras use the onvif ptz protocol to control and report their position.
with the correct setup, a flow block can read this position in real-time and react to its changes.
once you set a camera's home position in flow insights, the block makes sure to stop analyzing the video feed each time the camera moves out of this position and resume analysis when the camera gets back.
let's see how to set this up in detail.
of course, first you need to set up your own ptz camera an have it accessible through the network.

adding ip cameras to flow flow 1.12 brings massive changes to file management and the options for file exporting and storage.
thanks to a new device-independent flow storage feature, all flow devices are able to reliably store the various traffic data and outputs from the real-time analysis locally on the device on hard drivers or sd cards.
this important concept for local data management will be further used in coming functions for traffic safety and traffic violation detection.
the first data producer, which stores the data to flow storage, is a new type of sink - trajectory sink.
trajectory sink gathers raw trajectories for a defined time slot in tlgx format, thus with 1.12 you can export the trajectories from any flow device and open the results in the trafficsurvey viewer for further offline analysis.
apart from the new features, flow 1.12 focused on improving stability, optimization of data transfers between insights and flow devices and video analytic performance.
next, we will explain the new features in flow 1.12 in more detail.
a: depends on the results needed.
it can be reduced to iot device using lorawan network.
iot devices consume only a couple of bytes hour.
for demonstration purposes, this guide presumes that there is at least one working analytic in your flow setup, that there is a zone filter in this analytic, and that there is a value widget attached to this zone.
guide each zone can be set up individually with its own rules.
if two zones overlap, only the rules of the last zone, i.e.
closest to the bottom in the zone table, will be applied.
basic setup we are continuously developing and improving flow.

in this article, we only describe it generally and compare it with the section on speed measuring.
once you georegister the footage, you will be able to see speeds in kilometers hour under object flags.
now let's look at some of the most used types of speed data gathering setups.
the first setup is for measuring speed in a specific road section.
it can be set up the same way you would set up the road section speed measuring except you do not need to enter the length of the movement.
you only need to place the gate at the beginning and at the end of the measured section and connect it with movement.
when you drag the movement over to the canvas and add a statistical widget to it you will be able to get the speed data from it in km h. evidence protocol file could not be created.
in this webinar, you were not only able to look behind the scenes of the safety analysis in trafficviewer but also get an overall understanding of what to look for and analyze when wanting to improve road safety.
you have also grasped the basics of how the movement prediction models work and how they allow us to measure various values that can detect dangerous situations.
we have then transferred this knowledge into action and looking at a case study done by our partner line degn landen from cowi which showed us how to improve safety around schools and on large roundabouts.

that's why it's best to use ptz cameras with a periodic movement pattern for tasks that don't require continuity of trajectories and continuous surveillance of a particular area.
examples of such tasks include: vehicle presence zone and widget setup how to get push notifications about analytics processing state flow framework specific ports: thanks to the concept of the program, students and lecturers can go through the whole process of traffic data analysis: from choosing traffic issues, shooting the video, analyzing the data, and making conclusions based on data outputs.
first of all, you have to choose the region of interest to make sure you are getting accurate data.
by blue polygon mark the road surface or other areas where you want to get the position-related data.
do not include: buildings, grassland, forest and similar surfaces where no objects are detected.
see an example of goof region of interest set up below.
flow notifications tab origin-destination flow graphs a: yes, the unit also works as a data collector.
the format and frequency of the data collection is fully configurable via the flow insights application.
it is also possible to save statistical information and register different traffic events.
the available data includes for example vehicle counts, average speeds, od matrix, histograms, and more speed - motion filter - filtering in canvas based on different speed parameters 1. run flow insights and press the start flow button.
by default, the flow graph displays the total number of objects that passed between the gates in the entire video sequence.
in the add o d flow graph field, you can mark a specific pair of gates for which you want to generate a flow graph.
you can also display a graph for multiple pairs of gates at once.
press ctrl and click on the desired pair of gates, then click add graph to the chart.
as mentioned earlier, the a flow device by itself isn't able to meet the requirements to communicate on the sdlc bus - mainly because the response timeout is too short.
that's why there's a need for a sdlc converter.
the luxcom em-hdlc converter has an sdlc connector and functions as a dr biu on the cu side - this means it automatically responds to call data and diagnostic requests from the cu.
a flow device can connect to its ethernet port.
by sending udp packets in a specific format, it can change the content of the converter's responses on the sdlc bus.
it's possible to analyze the traffic at each position.
first, you need to go to the camera web interface and set up the movements between the desired positions.
then all that is left to do in flow insights is to set up a new analytic for each position you want to analyze.
make sure to use the same rtsp and onvif source strings.
then you can set up a different home position and possibly operator layout for each new analytic.
easy as that.
now you are able to send your first message from flow via lorawan.

we were the first on the market to extract precise traffic analytics from drone footage in 2013. we introduced a trajectory-based paradigm to traffic analytics, exponentially increasing the wealth of available information.
since then, were a worldwide-recognized leader in the field, bringing never-before-possible insights into traffic.
we identify all the cars, vans, pedestrians, and other traffic participants, classify them and track them.
we measure their positions, velocities, idle times, and all the other relevant parameters to present a rich and accurate description of the traffic situation.

advanced counting solution our traffic ai is trained on millions of hours of traffic videos captured in all weather conditions including snow, rain, fog, dark or overexposed scenes.
due to the long-term development of the key components of automatic traffic data extraction, the system is extremely robust and highly reliable in all mentioned cases.
track colouring possibilities now you can see that the channel's value changes in real time based on what's happening in the scene in the zone the widget belongs to.
if there's a traffic object in the zone, the call request value becomes true.
the flow traffic evidence feature represents an advancement in traffic event documentation.
it enables users to specify which images should be captured to document specific traffic events.
as a result, only particular situations are recorded, and these images can be obtained in one output once available.
for example, you could configure the system to capture images for a vehicle making a u-turn at three different stages: entering the intersection while the vehicle's license plate is still visible, during the vehicle's maneuver within the intersection, and finally, as the vehicle exits the intersection.
this feature makes flow a highly customizable tool for precise traffic monitoring and analysis.

comparison operators , , one example of how you can use the expression widget is to calculate the number of free parking spaces.
to do that you first need to add a zone, set it to live, and also add a value widget to it.
without the expression widget, you could only get the number of cars currently present in the zone.
expression widget allows you to create a script, where you input the total number of spaces in the parking lot and deduct the number of cars currently present in the zone "parking zone - n. currently occupied spaces" .
let's say we have a parking lot with a capacity of 18 places.

movements url: thanks to a combination of deep traffic analysis with number plate recognizer, the outputs of the function are extremely accurate.
number plate detection is run only at vehicles recorded with a suitable angle.
based on tracking of the vehicles trajectory, the final output is continuously made more accurate via the aggregation of the partial outputs.
this method ensures almost total elimination of false-positive detections, which are rather common at other traffic analysis tools e.g.
number plate detection at road signs, vehicle pasting, etc.
.
moreover, the number plate recognizer optimizes itself for the concrete video, making the whole process even more accurate.
you can try the number plate detection tool functionality by opening the sample analysis, which is free of charge, within the viewer application.

update requirements: second, we create a zone in which we want to detect shoulder parked vehicles by drawing until we connect the lines to form at least a three-sided shape.
we always select slightly larger areas to account for vehicles being shown outside their lanes.
after creating it we name the zone "shoulder parked vehicle detection zone".
you can draw any number of zones in the analytics.
after the zone s are created we drag them over to the canvas on the right side and connect them to the category filter.
10 in this example, let's say our scene contains an intersection and we want to find out how much traffic crosses it in each hour for 24 hours, divide the traffic participants into categories and get their entry and exit point data for the intersection.
this will be easy to do with distribution and od matrix widgets.
however, widgets need to be attached to an operator.
since we're interested in the whole area of the intersection, we need one that selects all trajectories in the scene.
in our case, we use the category filter that includes all categories except pedestrians, because our survey is interested only in road users.
you can take advantage of powerful flow api - rest and udp sinks to achieve true real-time integration.
furthermore, flow is able to control third-party devices with relay outputs directly.
these ports and protocols are critical to making the flow framework fully functional.

url: tangential acceleration only in aerial mode.
a positive value means acceleration and a negative value means deceleration.
trajectories of traffic objects tracked in the scene are not entirely set in stone.
as the traffic object moves and the trajectory evolves, the tracker running inside the flow block automatically corrects previous parts of the trajectory to be more precise.
some trajectories may even be merged together.
this process takes place as long as the traffic object is present in the scene.
at this point, the trajectory is considered open.
only when the traffic object leaves the scene can the whole trajectory be finalized and closed.
url: datafromsky trafficsurvey post-processing service can recognize up to 12 classes of objects.

one for aerial platform introduction to data sinks and flow insights' public api a flow cube receives trajectories from one or multiple flow nodes and merges those that belong to the same traffic object.
if, for example, several cameras watch different parts of an intersection and a vehicle passes across, it may show up in different camera feeds at various times, which results in multiple trajectories being generated and sent to a flow cube one for each camera feed in which the vehicle has been detected .
the flow cube then recognizes that these trajectories belong to the same vehicle and merges them into one.
from now on the trajectory isnt constrained to the space of one video feed, but is anchored in real-world coordinates.
a flow cube typically works with all flow nodes from the same traffic intersection and sends merged trajectories to a flow block.

thanks to heatmaps or gridmaps available in trafficsurveyviewer .exe you can visualize data such as velocity, acceleration, stationary time, object density, or time to collision.
trajectory extraction from video feeds, video files, and other sources can be done on a wide range of devices from ai cameras to powerful servers.
all processing can be distributed across a dynamic number of devices according to current needs.
thanks to its high processing speed, flow is suitable even for time-critical tasks like controlling traffic lights based on lane occupancy.
flow features a plethora of settings you can tweak.
this article shows their general overview.

do you know that for most of history the main traffic measuring method was people watching the road and writing down on paper what passes by?
even today this method is used but much easier and innovative methods are replacing it.
imagine if you could track and record all of the objects passing through multiple junctions with video no matter their number and collect the exact trajectories.
this type of advanced traffic data could be used in traffic capacity simulation and safety analysis and could also easily checked in retrospective.
we came up with a solution that can do all of that.
in 2013 we designed datafromsky video analysis method for conducting trafficsurveys based on trajectory driven design.
this revolutionary new method was perfected to the point where we can gather data from multiple junctions over a large area with the help of drones which was never possible before.
one such real-life example from the eu will be presented by our project partner from roelofs in this webinar.
the gathered traffic data can be viewed and analysed for vehicle counts, speeding and more in the trafficviewer programme.
also the datafromsky analyses have high precision of up to 30cm and 7,5 degrees.
a: it is possible to have 2 drones connected to one processing unit.

how to make a visual export from datafromsky viewer?
a: no.
flow is for live processing only but we have the trafficsurvey product which is designed for this purpose.
we are able to analyse large areas and track the whole trajectories of objects within these areas.
for example we did a traffic survey for a 1km long area covering multiple junctions.
you can hear more about it in this webinar.
did you know that flow can help control intersection traffic lights?
each such intersection should be controlled by a traffic controller.
if this controller supports the nema ts-2 standard, it communicates over the sdlc bus with terminal devices that help gather information or actuate parts of the intersection.
the luxcom em-hdlc converter can serve as a detector device that can receive vehicle presence information from flow and send it to the traffic controller, which can use it to optimize its traffic light cycle length for the best possible vehicle throughput.
you might need to coordinate with air traffic control or other responsible bodies.
datafromsky aerial - you will always receive consistent traffic data in time and space which is not affected by unwanted movements of the drone.
stabilization is an integral part of our processing.
q2: what are the available data outputs and other outputs?
and what about the costs?
with dfs service you pay only for hours of the video that you upload to our datafromsky ai platform.
you get a 5-minute sample video 10x samples per 24hours maximum to help you decide if you want a full analysis.
we also give you three credits to get started with our services!
how the data can be used as mentioned in the spatial filters article, zone filters create masks that consider only the parts of trajectories that are inside the zones.

url: 45:28 q4: what type of processor unit is used in embedded?
property filters in flow insights unique event id - unique id of an event.
group operators, which tie trajectories into groups based on certain criteria, like being on a collision course with each other.
webinar summarries read why the others are copying us since 2013. we also recommend minimizing occlusions in the view on the scene in order to maximize the traffic analysis accuracy.
it is useful for the input video to be as stable as possible with the area of the interest kept in the view throughout the whole video capture process to prevent misleading gate counting - since the video is not georegistered.
autorecover functionality helps to make sure video data is being received and processed, fighting communication issues as well as errors on the node level.
it can be set up individually for each analytics in their respective settings as shown in the picture below.
with a few minutes on our hands and flow operators at our disposal, we have turned an ordinary traffic camera into a highly capable sensor.
we have extracted vehicle counts with a lane resolution and evaluated the vehicle type distribution within the traffic flow.
at the same time, the camera was set up to detect dangerous situations in the scene and immediately alert the highway infrastructure via api if a problem in case one arises.
this way we can prevent accidents and potentially save lives.
communication between flow insights and flow node inbuilt flow lpr is able to read lp once and then remembers it for the whole duration the object is present in the area and you can trace the trajectory of the object before the object was detected as well.
you can see an example of this in the gif above.
from flow version 1.11 you can create an anonymized motion jpeg mjpeg for short video stream via http and from flow version 1.13 you can visualize and monitor the video output of the video analytics in this stream that is accessible on port 8090. read on to learn more.

importing settings 31:55 q2: how many detection categories are available?
example of a real traffic cabinet: the datafromsky light engine can process data from any video input such as static handheld consumer camera or footage from an existing cctv infrastructure.
for the best traffic analysis results we recommend the following input video parameters: learn how to work with gates, zones and movements.
the time of occurrence filter "data_end_timestamp": "1695038364800", the number of left waiting vehicles - how many cars there are left in the waiting lane after the first blocking vehicle passed.
until now there were very few mobile traffic monitoring systems such as special vans altered for surveillance and monitoring with radar and camera equipment that were quite expensive.
despite them having a very good range the data they provided was limited and useful for a few applications such as speed detection or seatbelt compliance with the speed detection radars serving only a single application.
police, the main user of such systems, also wanted to detect things such as vehicle gap times, aggressive driving, or measure speed with one solution and were looking for a more cost-efficient alternative.
thanks to the combination of drone technology coupled with the latest capabilities of ai traffic analysis a new much more versatile and affordable solution - the trafficdrone was born.
system reboot was triggered by autoreboot settings.
a flow device opens two ports that flow insights needs to connect to: trafficembedded and trafficenterprise now have built-in license plate reading.
the currently supported license plates include all of the european countries.
support for more lp formats will be added over time.
a new operator has also been added to include exclude specific license plates.

files from the same group can be easily downloaded together and then imported into the trafficsurvey viewer to where you can analyze all the data together.
q 10. is it possible to remote control the trafficdrone unit for remote config central monitor purposes if internet is provided on-site?
among motion filters you can find the time of occurrence filter and the similarly named duration of occurrence filter.
the difference is that the time of occurrence filter selects trajectories that were in the scene at a specific time or time interval , whereas the duration of occurrence selects trajectories that were in the scene for a specific duration of time.
a trajectory starts to exist with its creation and ceases to exist with its closure.
let's look at the time modes this filter offers.

both trafficsurvey and flow have license plate reading functionality and their lpr capabilities have a couple of things in common.
one of the commonalities is that once a license plate has been read it is associated with the trajectory for its whole duration meaning you can tell what is the license plate of a car even though its lp is no longer visible in the camera view.
license plate reading must be done from light views from cameras ideally in 9-15 meter height so that the camera can see the license plate well.
both flow and trafficsurvey engines are quite flexible in terms of the angle at which it is able to read the license plate.

flow 1.16 supports additional connection types aka communication mode for io devices the web and secured web.
the web connection allows you to control multiple flow devices, but it doesn't handle conflicts when multiple devices try to control the same relay, so it's important to avoid controlling one i o interface from multiple flow devices.
the secured web connection works similarly to the web connection, but it adds an authorization header for increased security.

thank you for your attention.
using the los operator alone or with zones is discouraged, because trajectories that have just entered a zone are masked to include only the short part within the zone.
such a part has a very small duration of occurrence and los , but still factors into the calculation of the average, thus skewing it before the traffic object even leaves the zone.
when you use gates and movements, the trajectories are only passed and factored into calculations once they finish their movement from the initial to the final gate.
the methods for conducting traffic studies have changed a lot over time and now we embrace advanced trajectory based video analysis as the go to method.

do you want to count vehicles in your video?
sure, no problem, first you have to set your own gates.
gates are virtual lines that are crossed by vehicles and other tracked objects.
you can set your own gates at any place in the video and you can change them any time you want.
gates are used to counting each kind of object in one or both directions or you can set gates to get more advanced analysis such as o-d matrix, gap time, time to follow, or average speed of the object within two gates and others.
there are multiple things that need to be done before starting the update process.

do not forget to connect them under category to count only pedestrians.
in the bicycle path example below, you can see that the camera angle is far from being perpendicular to the road and captures quite a large distance.
in such cases, its better to choose more than three points to increase the accuracy of the georegistration process.
possible georeferencing points include e.g.
the two trees, five roadside bollards, the painted road sign, and the corner where the road surface widens.
most of these objects are a part of the cyclist path and therefore form a horizontal surface.

once you confirm the inserted points' values, a new window with the deviation of values is shown.
these values should be as low as possible.
we do not define maximum deviation because these values might vary based on the character of the video.
other changes user-skills: basic it's possible to find out utm coordinates of a specific point with online tools like geoplaner and input them in flow just like with the wgs 84. however, the power of utm lies in the ability to define your own local coordinate system.
that's because unlike wgs 84, utm coordinate system is orthogonal.
this means that it's basically a grid, where the pythagorean theorem is true and you can work with it on a local level just like with a cartesian coordinate system.
if you define a local system, it doesn't matter which hemisphere and zone you select.
what matters is only the relative values of coordinates.
then, the absolute global positions of traffic objects reported by flow will be wrong, but speed, acceleration, and position within the local coordinate system will still be true.

traffic congestion costs europe about 1 of its gross domestic product gdp every year.
this value is even bigger at 3,5 for some latin american countries.
many stakeholders are looking to tackle this phenomenon but in order to do that we first need to understand it.
flow is a universal detector that can use any ip camera to measure parameters that are necessary for examining traffic jams such as vehicle counts and category distribution, level of service, congestion length, stationary time, delay time, or vehicle speed.
you can also use flows real-time data for adaptive traffic control which can reduce traffic congestion in junctions with traffic lights.
in this article, we will show you how to detect traffic jams with various methods with a focus on the level of service measurement method.
we will also show you how to get many other useful data types for detecting and examining traffic congestions.
automated license plate reading alpr or also called lpr or anpr in flow can allow you to identify which vehicles, when, and where violated traffic rules and communicate this information further.
thanks to trajectory data flow is uniquely equipped with wrong-way driving detection, illegal lane change, and u-turn detection that are impossible to detect with most systems.
if a license plate is detected at any point in the trajectory journey it is assigned to it and its respective object.
flow is also quite flexible in terms of the angle at which it is able to read the license plate.
as you can see in the gif below the lp is detected even with the license plate being only a few pixels and the lp detection stays on the car even when it is no longer readable!
what is the difference?
this value concerns the flow node instead of the block.
it defines how often it outputs images and trajectories and therefore how often it's evaluated by the block, but lower values are more computationally demanding.

correct tf and tg computation with selectable reference planes step 2 - create monitoring widgets simply pick points such as building corners, traffic light poles, public light poles, or even edges of lines on the road can work.
the points should be close to or in the traffic objects paths and spread around the whole area where they travel.
make sure the points dont all lie on the same line.
if using a tall object such as a tree for a mark point, you need to make sure you place the georeferencing point at the location where that object touches the horizontal surface.
you can zoom in to help you position the marking point with better accuracy.
the further the point is from the camera, the more sensitive the georeferencing process is to the precision of the point's placement.

in the scheme below you can see the supported traffic lights types: url: datasheet txr-nx-v008 the options for getting speed data are much more limited with section speed measuring.
it always involves having a movement for which you need to know its distance and at least 2 other objects that define the area of the movement.
these can be gates, zones, or a combination of them.

flow differentiates between the terms time and duration.
time is single or multiple points in time with their own timestamps, whereas duration is a single value expressing how long something lasted.
in other words, time is a matter of "when?"
and duration is a matter of "for how long?".
for headways you can calculate statistics per each gate that you have set: why get the trafficcamera starter kit?

tram in the camera web interface, you can set up and monitor a variety of parameters of the smart camera for example the zoom settings, ir mode, network settings, password and more.
you can also change the ip address of the camera there.
by default, 100 entries per page are listed.
then we will need rtsp stream addresses.
depending on the manufacturer the rtsp address is slightly different.
what they have similar however is the beginning of the address which is in the following format: which in breakdown consists of: rtsp: preposition, username, password, ip address, and port number.
the path file that goes at the end of the address is different depending on the camera manufacturer.
below you can see the different endings of the most important camera manufacturers.
based on this information you can easily create the rtsp link you need to enter into your flow device.
outputs: map visualization of registered analytics next, we will draw 4 gates in the junction.
one for each direction.
we need to be careful to draw the gate so it covers the whole direction.
for example, for the bottom side gate, we need to stretch it to the right as there is a separate traffic lane for turning right.
or you can use a perpendicular view to the traffic, so the perspective of the whole scene is more suitable for the identification of objects and their position.
step 4 - wrong-way driving learn more about the trafficxroads unit.
all things flow including basics, guides, release changes, data communication and more one of the other changes worth mentioning is that the network communication between the flow node and block has been optimized reducing the bandwidth requirements.
thanks to these changes you can now connect to flow edge devices even with mobile internet with data transfer speed under 512kbit s such as lte and still be able to configure it without any problems.
for the trafficenterprise system with hundreds of cameras a connection with a speed of at least 6 mbit s is sufficient.

framerate represents the sampling frequency of measurements.
for vehicle speed up to 70 km h, it is possible to use a framerate of 15 fps.
for vehicle speed over 50 km h, it is better to use a sampling frequency around 25 fps.
sampling frequency over 35fps has no further positive effect on the quality of measurement, but only makes the video and its size unnecessarily large.
this demonstration was hosted by elistair with the superwidget feature, you are now able to combine several values or expression widgets into one by simply dragging and dropping.
that allows you to display the chosen values in an understandable visual chart for easier comparison.
as you can see, there is already a chart under the numbers as a result of the time series visualization being enabled.
however, because the widgets have been collecting data for a very short time, the graphs display only two points for now.
it's possible to resize the widgets so that they can fit more points, like in the following example.
the excel export gives you a utc time format.
to get the correct format you need to account for this and use: 3600000x difference in the number of hours and based on the time zone either add or subtract these hours from the exported time value.
georegistration means placing multiple points across the footage and entering their coordinates to bind the footage to a specific real-world location.
section speed measuring is simply knowing the distance between 2 gates and entering this distance into the movement spatial filter placed between them.

traffic jam detection - how-to series in flow insights a: standard mode has 17 classes: pedestrian, animal, bicycle, motorcycle, car, van, light, heavy, bus, tractor, car trailer, truck trailer, caravan, tram, pram, scooter, and wheelchair.
these classes can be specifically counted in the analysis - for example you can detect number of heavy trucks passing through a given area.
passengers-carrying large buses, and school buses for more than 8 passengers.
flow is able to periodically save the cumulative numbers stored in operators and widgets.
in case of the flow block's sudden shutdown, it will load the last saved data for each analytics on its next launch.
because the trajectory cache isn't included in the autosaves, each analytics' cache will be empty on launch.
however, thanks to the fact that the operator and widgets' cumulative values have been stored, the output of sinks and widgets will be preserved if they are of the following types: count, statistical value, or distribution.
therefore, the effect is the same as when widgets cumulate values from trajectories that have been deleted from the cache due to space constraints, except, in this case, the cache is completely empty and will start to fill up after the flow block's launch.
the newly detected trajectories will then cumulate normally with the widgets' previous values.

let the traffic flow with flow!
no you don't.
you can use your existing cameras continue your tour to learn more.
learn about the the holy trinity of reliable traffic data gathering the trajectory indicator is based on the assumption that in low visibility, trajectories should be shortened since long-range detection is not possible.
it, therefore, compares the average length of the trajectories in the defined time frame and zone with the reference length.
to configure it, it is necessary to define a zone polygon and set a minimum average length threshold and an evaluation time frame, along with a category filter to remove objects that may distort the measurement.
the answer is simple: do the georegistration!
url: fps displayed in flow insights we offer multiple real-time solutions that run flow, each suitable for different scenarios.
we have the plug n play smart trafficcamera which is perfect for simple scenarios such as straight two-lane roads.
for more complex traffic scenes, we provide the trafficembedded which gives super-detailed data for more complex scenes on a single camera but can support up to 6 cameras.
both the trafficcamera and trafficembedded process data on edge.
you can even use an unlimited number of existing city cameras with our trafficenterprise solution, which processes the data in the cloud or on a city server and manage traffic flow across the whole city.

in this article we will go over the user management in flow covering both the my account and users sections.
that page isnt here anymore flow blocks can keep a large but still only limited number of the most recent trajectories in their memorythe cache.
therefore when the cache is full and a new trajectory is created, the one with the oldest time of closure is completely deleted and therefore can't be a factor in any more calculations.
that's why when you inspect past trajectories, from a certain point in time it will seem as if no trajectories existed before it.
this point is different for each machine depending on how large cache it can handle and for each scene and time depending on traffic density .

in flow insights, you can view the output of any operator through widgets, which are all visualized on the dashboard.
normally, based on your chosen time mode, you can only view the present value or one of the past values this widget has ever had.
some widget types, however, allow you to view a history of their values in customizable charts.
these types include the value, statistical value, and distribution.
it's also possible to combine several value widgets into a pie chart.
let's take a closer look at these options.

beware: if you create a gate or a zone over an existing movement, they will not be automatically paired.
you can pair them manually by selecting the movement to go into its editing mode, then double click the gate or zone you want to pair it with, then click once more to confirm.
in this article, we will show you how easily you can feed real-time flow data to traffic controllers using udp sinks.
to test the flow and try to implement data integration with your traffic controller, there is no need to have a real flow device analyzing the real camera view.
to make the integration super-easy for you, we have prepared flow insights demokit which contains the simulated live camera view on the intersection with emulated flow device running on your localhost windows only, linux version on request .
the emulation is 1:1 - thus you develop and test the communication using the sw kit and then simply replace it with the real flow device such as trafficcamera or trafficxroads unit and it is done.
to have all the parts before the start and see how the data connection may work, we also provide a python script simulating the receiving part i.e.
traffic controller, which connects to the flow device, subscribe for udp zone sinks data, and print the raw messages to the console.
see the tutorial video and follow the steps to test it on your own.
by selecting the intruder count widget, its representation is embedded into the expression string as 3-0-15"intruder count".
we manually add 0 to make it explicit.
the meaning of the whole expression could be translated as: "if the value of the widget 'intruder count' is greater than zero, set the result as true."
whenever the expression is evaluated as true, the corresponding output relay on the i o interface is switched on, otherwise, it's switched off.

traffic lights state detection is available from flow 1.13 for trafficenterprise, trafficxroads, and trafficembedded.
the specific configuration can differ based on the va modules addons .
when the traffic lights start blinking the output state of detection might switch between off and the currently visible state.
the detection of traffic lights is running in real-time and is done roughly three times a second.
the delay is determined by the transmission and the camera and is usually below 300ms.

error using widgets to view traffic data in flow insights message definition counting cyclists can be useful for multiple reasons.
one of them is when you want to build a cyclist path.
before you build it, you might want to see how many cyclists are using the road in the given direction to see if this would be a good decision.
another example is to have a visual counter that shows the cumulative number of cyclists that use the path which encourages biking instead of using cars, scooters, etc.. which does not only improve traffic in the city but is also good for the environment and the peoples health.
read this step-by-step guide and learn how easy it is to set up a cyclist counter to reduce traffic in your city.

in flow insights, motion filters select trajectories based on conditions regarding their motion.
you can drag any of them onto the canvas and connect them with other filters.
make sure that you have the zones in the correct order.
the first zone in the script should be the one with the highest number and the one the cars pass through first.
the scripts evaluate the thresholds in order, checking whether the condition is met.
if it is not, it moves to the next road segment and the next one which makes the congestion detected smaller and smaller.
the number under the operator shows how many trajectories are currently passed further by it.

one of the many ways we can measure traffic congestion length in flow is to use zones in conjunction with the expression widget.
we will create a simple example with a couple of zones and scripting custom calculations in the expression widget.
based on the number of cars present in the zones, we can estimate the length of the traffic congestion.
this simple script uses a simple concept - if a road segment zone fills up with a specified number of cars the script will detect it as congested.
depending on whether the zones are congested or not - the traffic congestion length is then calculated.
so for example, if you have 2 zones that total up to 50 meters in length and your car limit is 12 cars per zone.
if there are 15 cars in the first zone and 8 cars in the second zone then- the traffic jam length will be estimated to be 25 meters.
in this case, by the first zone, we mean the zone farthest down the road.
if both zones would be below 12 cars it would be 0 meters and if both zones would have at least 12 cars then it would be 50 meters.

lets consider a trajectory whose duration of occurrence previously called time of passage in the whole scene is 30 seconds.
the vehicle that this trajectory belongs to passed through zone 1 in 3 seconds.
such a trajectory wouldnt pass through the left analytic, because it first selects trajectories with the duration of occurrence of 5 seconds or less.
the trajectory, however, would pass through the right analytic, because zone 1 would first crop the trajectory to the 3-second window of the vehicle passing through it.
region of interest allows you to define a rectangular area where the video analysis will be applied.
all parts outside this region will be ignored.

defining a region of interest does not increase the number of frames that the detector can process per second.
currently, flow supports these types of i o interfaces: basically, you have three options to connect to a device from your favorite list: learn how to export and import the settings of the flow block to make a backup or help our support team identify problems.
we all know that sometimes the traffic sign placement is not optimal but stop signs on narrow city street corners make perfect sense and improve safety by a lot.
unfortunately, enforcing drivers compliance can be complicated but flow is here to help.
smart traffic cameras running flow can provide actionable real-time information and evidence to help reduce this unwanted behavior.
the los reported by value widgets and sinks are calculated from average duration of occurrence of input trajectories.
with widgets, you can enable history visualisation to see how the los on your intersection evolved over time.

another change worth mentioning is the addition of another i o interface type - quido eth 8 8. also a new flag value detection confidence is now available allowing you to peek into the ai detection and see how confident the ai is about the classification of the object into the assigned category.
the registration itself is done by mapping three points in the scene to real-world coordinates.
there are two possible coordinate systems in which you can do this.
you could also simulate the live stream to do the offline analysis but it would take same time to do as the video recording.
another alternative would be to deploy trafficsurvey video analysis software from us on the trafficdrone mobile processing unit.
new i o interface connection type: web move to position c, spend z seconds stationary you can easily download a demo kit that contains a sandbox environment for flow insights so you can try everything described in this article yourself.
basically, if you can switch something on and off, you can let it be controlled by flow based on the outputs from video detection.
so let's take a closer look at what i o interface are, how to get one, and how to work with them.
if you already know how to work with your i o interface learn how to use it for adaptive traffic control in this article.
necessary for the update of trafficxroads and trafficembedded units via flow insights select the apps tab flow block notification settings.
the first variable notifications - time window: sets a time interval in which any type of message can only occur once, to prevent too many messages generated for the same event.
the rest of parameters refer to messages in the above list marked configurable.
as the detected number plate or hash is an additional attribute to the vehicles trajectory, spatial, time, and even attribute filters can be easily applied to it within the datafromsky viewer application.
therefore, it is not a problem to acquire a list of number plates or hashes or even a group of vehicles in a certain direction, or of a certain category, and use only one export function for the whole data export.
the vehicles number plate or hash is then one of the attributes within the generated csv file, which can be easily used and processed in any third-party application.

to have a nice overview of the situation we can add a trajectory view widget to the category filter.
this will show us all the cyclist trajectories on the dashboard.
to have even more insights we might add a statistical value widget to the union operator and select speed under the operator attribute.
with this widget, we can see the relative speeds including maximum, minimum, and average speeds.
georegistering your analytics allows you to transform the pixel world to real-world coordinates and measurements.
this allows you to pinpoint the actual location of objects and therefore to measure distances and get speed data in km h , which in turn can give you a better overall understanding of traffic.
possible uses include detecting traffic congestion based on speed or identifying how various factors such as time of day, vehicle category, the direction of movement, and others relate to speed.

the first example from the left is not suitable because of the uniform texture the contrast is about 2.0 which is very low .
the second example has good contrast, but only temporarily because this is due to the shadow from the barrier which can change over time as the position of the sun changes.
the last example represents a good location because the contrast is high during the day 40 and will be significant even at night if the road is artificially lit.
when thinking about the design of your traffic survey, here are a few points to observe: the nema ts-2 standard defines up to 4 possible dr bius, each biu with 16 detector channels, therefore up to 64 detectors total.
in the original design, the detectors are supposed to be induction loops hidden under the road.
flow and the converter have to somewhat emulate this behavior.
this means that detector outputs are limited to simple "true false" values, meaning "vehicle presence detected" and "vehicle presence not detected" respectively.
however, as you'll see later, flow gives you great freedom in deciding how the true false value is determined.
"data": url: whole video sequence you can choose whether to export the whole video or only part of it.

gates are virtual lines that are crossed by vehicles and other tracked objects.
you can set your own gates at any place in the video and you can change them any time you want.
gates are used to count each kind of object in one or both directions or you can set gates to get more advanced analysis such as o-d matrix, gap time, time to follow, or average speed of the object within two gates and others.

flow devices communicate with quido i o modules using a tcp connection, therefore it is necessary to set this as a communication mode on the i o module which is set to web by default .
the i o module will then act as a tcp server and the flow device as a client.
to do this we need to go to the i o module web interface.
to access it, enter the ip address of the i o module into the browser.
the ip address can for example look like this: 192.168.88.245. by default the i o module is in dhcp mode, you should change this to a static ip address for permanent setups.
you also need to be in the same network as the i o module to be able to connect to it with the flow device.

2. learn about modern city camera based solutions using datafromsky footage analysis method and the traffic analysis framework flow we are aware that the license plate numbers are sensitive data that in many cases cannot be collected and further analyzed even though information about the behavior of a particular object is key for research purposes.
datafromsky offers a simple solution for such cases.
using the hash function, we convert the detected number plate to another numeric value that is not reversible but unique to each object.
your data will still contain information about the behavior of the object, but will no longer include sensitive information.
when ordering number plate detection, you can choose to save the data as a hash default or as a plain text.
we care about security and privacy!
if you would have a narrow use case let's say detection of only one type of car then the neural network could be optimized for that and achieve 100 accuracy with a sufficient dataset.

how to export data from trafficsurvey viewer in 5 minutes?
you can use the state of the traffic lights in the expression widget such as a simple value or statistical widget.
this allows you to create a conditional evaluation based on the current state of the traffic lights which may be needed if you want to, for example, count the number of redlight runners.
the traffic lights state instanced via expression widget can be communicated via webhooks.
in the expression definition, the traffic lights states are substituted by integer values.

cameras, a crucial component of the video analytics solution setups, are directly exposed to external weather conditions where visibility is severely affected by various elements and factors such as rain, ice, fog, soil, ..etc.
hence, it is critical to detect bad visibility conditions to automatically switch them to an error state when sufficient data output quality cannot be achieved.
despite these occurrences being rare it is important to know when these conditions are present for traffic controllers to be able to switch to automatic traffic control mode.
for this purpose, we have designed the visibility state detection which allows all flow devices to detect both abrupt and gradual changes in the input image that impact the accuracy of traffic object detection and tracking.
expression widget admin can see and manage all analytics.
analyst and viewer roles, on the other hand, have their access defined for each analytic separately, by default they will, however, have the access set to their user role level of access meaning that analyst will have their rights set to analyst on all the analytics.
this level of access will be also applied to newly added analytics.
the level of access for the individual analytics of analysts and viewers can be changed by admins.
admins can also completely remove access for analysts and viewers.
when you export settings, flow creates a .zip archive on the hard drive of the machine that runs flow insights.
this archive can only be extracted through the import process by a flow block or by flow's support team.
it contains all the settings available in flow insights, namely: autosave is an important safety feature for protecting gathered data making sure that all historical data of widgets and data sinks that support historical data is saved at the specified intervals and therefore protected in case of power outages.
on the other hand, if the power down of the device is not likely, you can either select big intervals for the autosave or leave this feature turned off as it does the write operation.
autosave feature can be set up for each analytic individually from the analytics settings as shown in the picture below.

one easy way to get gps wgs-84 coordinates is to use google maps.
there, you can simply go to the location you want to georegister and right-click at the point whose coordinates you want to find out.
this opens a menuat the top of it, youll see the coordinates.
click them to copy them to the clipboard so that you can paste them into trafficsurvey viewer.
position the drone so that dynamic and static occlusions are avoided.
occlusions increase the probability of failure of object tracking and of disengagement of continuous trajectories - in other words, one object would have a higher number of shorter trajectories.
datafromsky system is robust against short occlusions, but long occlusions can cause the disengagement of continuous trajectories into more parts.
they're a piece of hardware that primarily receives commands on their ethernet interface and, according to their contents, switches electronic relays on their outputs.
the outputs can be seen in the picture aboveeach output has an upper and a lower port.
the relay can connect or disconnect these two ports, so if you connect wires to them, the interface can control the flow of electricity between them.
this article guides you how to add cameras to trafficembedded and trafficenterprise systems.
being able to analyze traffic for longer time periods and getting statistics out of them has been one of the main goals driving flow's development.
thanks to this, our clients all over the world can gain insights into how traffic flows in their particular area, feed the resulting data into their traffic models, design better solutions and better infrastructure for everyone.
all of this from a video camera feedwithout any induction loops.
this article explains how to set up your flow device for a survey and how to obtain its results after it's finished.
trafficembedded is a powerful embedded device that can run up to six nodes at oncetypically receiving video feeds from up to six cameras, extracting trajectories from the images, and sending them further to a cube.
url: directional control gives you a powerful tool to focus on trajectories crossing the gate in a specified direction.
this option needs to be defined in the gate properties window.
by default, gates are bi-directional, which means that trajectories crossing them in any direction are passed to their output.

connecting to a network focusing and exposure control should ensure the vehicles objects are not blurred in a take.
objects should be contrasting but not overexposed nor too dark.
this should be considered even at the expense of other parts of the shot.
in the case of night recordings or recordings at low light conditions, it is important to ensure that traffic elements are visibly identifiable besides vehicles.

us department of transportation systems like the detection of wrong-way driving can help to prevent these accidents on multiple levels.
first by alerting the driver with flashing led warning signs as they try to come onto the highway in the wrong way to help them realize they need to stop.
second by warning other drivers with variable message signs to be alert and reduce speeds and third by alerting police to assist the driver or try to stop them.
the police can also notify radio news to alert more drivers.
our ai video analysis framework flow can help by detecting the wrong-way driving in real-time and not just on highways.

in the first and most important block settings section, you can set the block's name, view, or set the current time.
either you set the time manually, or you specify a space-separated list of ntp server addresses from which the block can pull the correct time.
note that time settings are not available on the demokit and on trafficcamera devices.
to set the time on trafficcamera devices, use their web interface.
more on how to set this up can be found in the trafficcamera manual.
one of the typical uses of the flow devices are real-time traffic monitoring tasks for dynamic control where the udp sinks are preferred for communication with traffic controllers due to its low latencies and lightweight payloads.
so far, flow supports only two options i.e.
zone sinks and classification count.
but with flow 1.13, you can start receiving the list of objects thanks to the new object list sink.
moreover, we have also improved the existing zone sinks which newly contain the list of trajectory identifiers, thus the receiving party knows which objects are presented in the zone.
besides that, we also added the configuration page for the udp server where you can define the port and max.

these parts are connected by a single full-duplex synchronous data link control sdlc bus, called port 1 in the nema ts-2.
the bus is full-duplex - the cu transmits on one channel and all other devices transmit on the other channel.
therefore there's a need for synchronization, so the other devices don't transmit at the same time.
the cu addresses specific devices with requests and the devices then have a timeout of 0.5 milliseconds to compose and start transmitting a response.

second, when you switch to the whole history mode, you can see a cache-only checkbox.
when it's checked, the corresponding widget or sink's output is calculated only from the trajectories that are in the cache at the time of calculation.
however, some widgets and sinks calculate their results step by stepthey remember their intermediate results and with each new trajectory they just update this result.
an example of this can be the statistical value widget that calculates values like maximum or average speed of selected trajectories.
for the maximum speed, it only needs to remember the current maximum and compare it with the maximum speed of the currently evaluated trajectory.

what makes trafficsurvey different?
filter your trajectories based on how freely the traffic currently flows.
obtaining the license from flow framework version 1.13 you are now able to detect the traffic lights states in real-time utilizing video analysis inside the built-in traffic lights detector.
all you need is an ip camera and a device running flow.
the traffic lights state data can then be used in flow insights to generate condition-based statistics or for live adjustment of the traffic light signal timing.
this means you can detect red-light running and increase safety through adaptive traffic control and interactive traffic signs.
you can do this for as many traffic lights as you need at the same time.
in this short guide, we will walk you through the setup of traffic light state detection in flow insights and important details that will help you get 100 results.
figure: two situations try to avoid changing the drone's position when recording, and also avoid recording against a strong source of light.
animal compared to georegistration getting average speed for whole footage is harder with section speed measurement as the starting locations of the trajectories are inconsistent due to the nature of the ai detection namely when comparing different object categories.
additionally, there is the disadvantage of having to set up at least 3 spatial filters to start getting the speed data.

the udp sinks work on subscribe basis.
this means that data is sent every time there is a change in the data monitored in flow.
for example, in the case of the zone sink with an option idlist in the subscription message, new data is sent whenever there is a change in the list of ids of objects.
we also support different sink types apart from the zone sink such as the object list sink, which sends a list of objects that have been detected, and if available it includes their location, speed data, classification, license plate, etc., and also the category sink which provides classified counts.
note that category sink differs in the communication policy, providing data only upon request.

resolution is a key attribute for the detection and classification of objects.
the minimum recommended size of an object within the image needed for detection and classification is 32x32 pixels.
the maximum size of the object for correct detection is 150x150 pixels in the whole monitored area within the intersection.
detection of pedestrians and cyclists with aerial can be more complicated so try to get more pixels for these if you want them detected as well.
also, note that the detection of pedestrians in crowds has lowered accuracy.

stationary time - data about how long the selected traffic objects have had zero velocity while in the scene.
once you've set up a flow device and i o interface and, if they're separate, connected them to a network, the only thing remaining is to let them talk to each other.
this section will demonstrate how to do that with a simple example.
level of service is a technical term used to describe a quality of vehicle traffic service, with loose definitions of each level.
with the los operator, you can define your own levels and then filter trajectories based on the level that they currently belong to.
flow implements the model based on control delay, which in flow's terms is the same as duration of occurrence.

we can also carry out the recording for you.
the recommended size of objects in the image is between 32x32 pixels to 150x150 pixels in the whole monitored area within the intersection as we have teased and promised we are adding additional categories, starting with animal which is a category that currently includes bigger four-legged animals like dogs and cats.
the van category has been added to further clarify the classification of larger vehicles that are now sorted into the van, light vehicle, heavy vehicle, and bus categories.
as usual, you can filter the objects from these using the category filter or you can visualize only these categories using the trajectory visualization filter in the live view.
visualize speed, acceleration, stationary time, object density or safety analysis through heatmap or gridmap setting up camera location this way you can gather the most important part of the data - the raw trajectories which can then be used for all the available types of traffic analysis including counts, speed measuring, getting od data, safety analysis such as ttc, pet, gap times and more.

spatial filters in flow how to design the flow?
1. how to create a basic parking monitoring setup.
there are two possibilities how to export gate crossing events.
you can export data for each gate or you can export overall statistics for all gates that you have set in your video.
if you have decided to export information about one specific gate, choose the gate in section traffic analysis objects.
you can see overall data such as gate unique id, gate tag, passed vehicles count , vehicle flow per 30 min , avg.
speed km h .
once you click to show in section detailed info, a new window called gate info: passed vehicles opens.
here you can see the list of all objects that passed through the chosen gate.
in the types field, you can check which types of objects you want to display.
if you double-click a track row in the table, a track appears in the scene view.
url: georegistration available in trafficsurvey aerial one of the factors is the angle of the camera.
if the camera is placed low and looking into the distance it will be impossible to get good speed data.
when talking about the speed-accuracy - it's very important to take into account the camera angle.
when the object is moving in the scene over a large distance in reality while the movement in the image of the camera is only minimal there will be a considerable inaccuracy.
on the other hand, if there is a large amount of visible movement in the camera image for that same distance, the accuracy will be much better.
the second thing to take into consideration is that the further away from the camera the object is, the more sensitive and susceptible to error the speed detection gets and the last thing is that a side view produces a large change in image therefore also increasing accuracy of speed when monitoring cars from the side .
please take these things into consideration when deciding on camera placement in cases that require good speed data.
dahua: dahua cam realmonitor?channel 1 avoid following views, such as obstacles between the camera and the traffic that might disrupt the trajectory, too wide view that cause distortions at edges of the video, too low camera position, so one vehicle is covered by another one, or in general where you can not see the horizon, so distortion in the data might be higher.
url: datafromsky can also analyze within 360 3 to see other visualization possibilities see the article how to visualize data in the video and how to make a visual export from datafromsky viewer.
overall statistics: you can see the overview of objects, the number of objects from each category, total distance traveled within the video or average speed in the analyzed video.
for example, if you would work with 2 movements, be it using union or intersection operator and you would have a trajectory that has passed through both of the movements, it would give you an average value for these two movements.

a: yes, it is possible if the unit is connected to the internet or other network within which you need to do the configuration.
the unit has its own ip address and can be configured using the flow insights desktop application.
the application allows for minimizing of the data requirements of the communication which makes configuration possible even when using slow data connections.
the unit supports customer vpn networks for example wireguard and softethernet.
the offset and time blocks modes also mask the selected trajectories to the set time period.
this means that calculations like average speed are done only from the parts of the trajectories that satisfy the time constraints.
this works similarly to the masking done by spatial filters and, just like with spatial filters, using set operators creates unions of the masks.
detect stop sign compliance - flow insights how-to series all widgets except trajectory view navigation we use highly sophisticated algorithms with high computational complexity to ensure 98 - 100 accuracy of your data in the shortest time.
this is possible mainly thanks to our fully automated parallel video processing on the cloud.
the volume operator counts the number of trajectories on its input.
if this count matches the defined condition, all the trajectories are passed to the operator output.
otherwise no trajectories are passed by the operator.

traffic regions list - information about which traffic region a given trajectory belongs to which traffic region or regions it is currently located for the given exporting step this can be used for further analysis, e.g.
if you define traffic regions as a road lane, you can detect the moment when a vehicle has moved from one lane to another, detect jaywalking and more... if you update your flow insights the current setting is that the favorite flow devices list will stay in its place if you are using the same installation folder.
if not then you need to insert the favorite flow devices list json data file into the installation folder again.
url: "analytic_id": 0, in datafromsky viewer some of the data might be exported to a .csv or .xls file.
for more information about each export, see the list below: prepare a folder named flow udp test with the script and a folder named out inside of it widgets visualize some aspect of traffic objects selected by the operator they are attached to.

add a category filter, select only the vehicle types you want the zone to react to, and connect the filter to the zone.
to detect only cars and not any pedestrians or bicycles passing through the zone we add a category filter to the canvas.
we double-click it to open its menu and we tick boxes to select appropriate vehicle categories.
we connect the category filter above the zone so that all the data is filtered by category first before going into the zone spatial filter.
some widgets allow you to view a history of their values, or combine the current values of several widgets into a superwidgeta pie chart.

if you would be interested in having a version for linux or mac please get in touch with us here.
if you have a point-and-zoom camera, you can connect flow to its onvif data stream.
this way, flow will be able to recognize the current camera position and zoom settings - you can use this information to assure that the video stream is being analyzed only when the camera captures the correct scene.
onvif source is entered in the following format: elevation of the camera: 10m 3. wait for your results - have a coffee : to ensure the high reliability of the flow devices, we have introduced multiple features to make sure you are gathering as much data in the best quality possible at all times.
autorecover functionality helps to make sure video data is being received and processed, fighting communication issues as well as errors on the node level.
autosave protects gathered data for widgets and sinks supporting history saving data at the specified intervals and lastly, autoreboot allows you to set up regular restarts of the device which can help to automatically recover from unexpected hw sw errors.
you can learn more about these features here.
evaluation period: 30 s trafficsurvey can detect all eu license plates as well as most alphanumerical-only license plates.
see the image below for examples of license plates that the trafficsurvey lpr service can read.
please note that in order to read a license plate reliably, it should be at least 18pixels in the vertical dimension but this is easily achieved for most videos.
you can also test whether license plates will be read in your video for free by ticking the lpr option when doing the 5-minute free sample analysis max 10x samples per 24hours .

gate id - unique id of the gate that you have set.
as mentioned in the introduction, flow can give you many more useful data types for examining traffic jams.
you can get a raw number of cars passing through a road section, car categories, or the vehicle speeds that you can get if you georegister the footage.
you could also measure passage time directly without converting it to the level of service or use expression scripting to calculate the delay cars incurred due to the congestion.
all these metrics can be filtered in time with the individual widget's settings.
you can select from a variety of time modes: now, time blocks - current and previous, floating time windows, or whole history.
with speeds, level of service, and passage times it is best to use 1-minute time blocks for representative and current data.
to communicate all the results of the analytics that we have set up we can add various sinks.
api data sinks together with i o interfaces allow easy integration of flow with other systems.
the exported excel file consists from the sheet overview, gate statistics, and turning movements overall and split by object category : admin - can add and remove users including admins, analysts and viewers and can do anything i.e.
add remove new analytics, add remove hardware and software interfaces i o relays, webhooks, sdlc, vms and do everything analyst can such as define traffic tasks, dashboards, data sinks etc.
the admins also have the right to change the system settings such as date-time, anonymization and do backups and updates.
in this guide, you have learned how to access map view, how to add device location and how to add the map key either to block or flow insights level.
we have also explained the benefits of using each of these approaches and when you should use which one.

it just means less ambivalence.
with five or more points, it's natural to have small error values due to measurement errors of the original coordinates.
adding more points is preferred to trying to minimize the error.
on the other hand, if you see an error of more than a few meters, then it's possible there's something wrong with the coordinates you entered, so try to double-check them.

the world of flow is based on trajectories.
the precise telemetry data about each road user is an essential building block for actionable traffic intelligence enabling interactive analysis and immediate actions.
a trajectory fully describes the motion of a traffic object, i.e.
where the object was at each point in time, and its metadata like color or license plate number.
such representation of traffic allows you to play with the data, interact with it to understand each traffic situation, explore it at any time and place to discover new traffic patterns, deeply analyze traffic interactions to predict future trends, or visualize and share it in any form you need.

this trafficcamera smart video analytics starter kit is a special opportunity to get started with smart video analytics and get familiar with flow - the ultimate multipurpose video analysis tool running on the camera.
flow is a powerful trajectory-based ai traffic analysis framework able to detect, classify and track objects across the scene allowing it to be used for many applications.
this article will provide you with a summary of the starter kit contents, a list of applications, reasons why flow is a valuable video analytics tool, and a quick 10-minute guide for setting up the camera so you can start experimenting and gathering data.
you can watch a live demonstration of the starter kit below.
periodically counting the number of people in a particular area, e.g.
a bus stop, and generating a service request event if their count crosses a threshold first, we drag and drop a category filter to the canvas.
we double click it to open its menu and we tick boxes to select the bicycle category as shown in the picture below.
we do this because we want to detect only cyclists.
when detecting cyclists it is important to have the right camera angle to be able to detect the bike from the side rather than from the front.
also, good detail of the scene is needed to have accurate detection.
the philosophy behind datafromsky in three sentences: widget types to get push notifications about the analytics processing state add a webhook and include a widget for processing state with a fixed period or on status change.

thanks to this feature it is possible to detect situations when the sensor is not working reliably or not at all.
this information is propagated in the system via the system widget and is automatically present in the udp, respectively sdlc interface.
when activating this feature we also recommend activating auto-recovery mode to ensure maximum reliability of the sensor, for example for adaptive traffic control use.
recommendation: we recommend turning this feature on for analytics that continually collects data and where this data is stored on the device for longer periods of time and data is not regularly downloaded.
if it is not necessary for your specific application we recommend leaving this feature turned off because it generates unnecessary write operations of big amounts of data on the device's persistent memory.
inability to create a file insufficient space when requesting to create an autosave file url: as of flow 1.11, there is a special license plate operator that can be used to include exclude specific license plates from the dataset and respond adaptively based on the detected license plates.
this can for example be used for parking management.
for instance, if you have company-managed parking you can add all the license plates of your company vehicles into the exclusion and then be notified when a vehicle with an unfamiliar license plate uses the parking lot.
below you can see how to set up your analytics for such use-case by using a license plate list of allowed vehicles and notifying you of any unauthorized vehicles in your parking lot.
to start detecting traffic lights states you need to come to the traffic lights settings section under analytics settings and highlight the area of the different traffic lights you want to detect as shown in the gif below.

the system is able to detect the vehicles moving up to 200 km h with timestamp accuracy in a millisecond.
to do this, two trafficembedded units were deployed - one per one measuring node with a camera.
the distance between the two measuring nodes is about 150 meters.
these units communicate via cellular network and are synchronized using gps-based time server.
due to missing permanent powering from light masts, the unit and camera are powered by a battery source with 120 ah capacity.

to be able to get more out of the current road capacity, municipalities are turning to smart technologies like traffic detection and traffic control to improve the situation.
however, making significant improvements to traffic flow has not been possible until recently.
for a long time, inductive loop technology was the only way to manage traffic adaptively but it could only do so much.
due to the high costs of inductive loops, only one was usually installed per lane meaning the traffic controller would only know that a car has recently passed in a specific point, with the use of current zone presence being limited to a very small area.
on the other hand, with flow devices, you can utilize udp sinks, namely the object sink which can tell the traffic controller the exact number of cars and their class that are currently present in each traffic lane giving the much-needed detail for much more efficient adaptive traffic control.
in addition to communicating the insights for real-time traffic controller decisions on the edge, the same camera can act as a multi-purpose sensor whose edge-extracted data can be pushed to or requested by 3rd party applications.
for example, it can provide information to traffic management or decision support systems.
in varadin the municipality wanted to improve traffic on a busy 4-arm intersection next to a shopping mall and a factory that also connects to the highway.
for this purpose, they have asked our partner traf signal to implement adaptive traffic control.
situation the municipality wanted to implement adaptive traffic control in general but did not have a specific requirement for how it should be done.
on top of being able to manage the traffic adaptively to improve the traffic flow, the municipality was offered that the solution could gather traffic statistics such as vehicle counts for each direction and distribution of the traffic in terms of the vehicle types to better understand the traffic composition at this intersection.
this was a free added value for them and therefore it was also implemented.
the solution also had to be gdpr compliant as this was a deployment in an eu member country.
the last challenge was that this junction was further from the city center so there was no internet cabling at the location, therefore, lte had to be supported in order to be able to send the real-time data to traf signal traffic management platform via a secured vpn.
to fulfill all of these quite demanding requirements in one solution, traf signal has decided to use trafficcameras by datafromsky with built-in flow video analytics specialized for traffic data gathering.
traffic junction in varadin with adaptive traffic control using trafficcameras datafromsky solution - trafficcameras the solution was to install smart trafficcameras with built-in video analytics on the traffic light poles, one for each of the intersection arms.
the cameras were able to detect incoming vehicles from a 70-meter distance allowing for responsive traffic signal switching without vehicles needing to stop when possible.
the cameras were directly wired to the traffic controller using ethernet switch for local communication of the real-time data using udp sinks.
the system also had a smart switch to wi-fi installed in case the specially secured cabinet door was open.
the cameras were installed on light poles by traf signal which was made easier thanks to detachable junction boxes.
the evaluation of vehicle trajectories extracted from the video streams was done by the flow framework running directly inside the smart trafficcameras.
the video analytics were also remotely set up by them including the zones and sinks for adaptive traffic control as well as the setup for gathering various traffic statistics.
example of a video analytics set up with visualized pedestrian trajectories our partner traf signal used its extensive expertise to set up and optimize the adaptive traffic control based on the real-time flow traffic data in two approaches depending on the traffic currently present at the junction.
in the first one, the traffic controller triggered a green light for the given direction when just a single car was present at the intersection.
in the second one, when the traffic levels increased the busier traffic lanes were given longer green light periods adaptively.
after the full installation of the system, the traffic flow improved by 30 compared to non-adaptive traffic control.
flow dashboard with real-time traffic statistics all aggregation is done by trafficcamera the trafficcameras also gathered traffic statistics such as the category distribution of traffic and the number of vehicles from each direction.
if the council wanted it would have also been possible to measure the approximate speed of vehicles approaching the intersection as well for all of the 4x directions.
the operating expenses of this system were significantly reduced thanks to the solution having only one lte modem and communicating this data at longer intervals instead of streaming it continuously.
one sim card was used for the whole intersection and if required by the municipality, it would be even possible to push a whole rtsp stream with this setup.
the edge processing of the data also ensured gdpr compliance.
moreover, only aggregated data was sent to the traf signal database with an interface that the city can access which further reduced data communication needs.
lastly, the traf signal system also generated low-bandwidth jpeg images for real-time previews of the cameras on their platform.
results the smartcameras provided much better long-term value, more functionality, and easier installation compared to induction loops which were considered the closest alternative solution.
continuous 24 7 monitoring and data gathering of detailed traffic statistics was achieved.
a cost-effective video-analytic traffic monitoring setup was deployed thanks to the solution being camera-based, thanks to smart data usage, and most importantly thanks to the multi-purpose nature of the flow framework.
a fully automated traffic control system was implemented taking into account traffic from each direction as well as the duration of the presence of vehicles in each of the waiting lanes and even the number of cars passing through the intersection for each green signal.
the trafficcameras are now gathering both real-time and long-term statistics at the same time about various elements of the traffic flow.
the whole system has been running since october 2021 with only minor adjustments.

video analytics technology has made massive progress thanks to improvements in hardware with a new generation of nvidia and intel chips, and massive leaps in the development of deep learning algorithms and computer vision.
the result?
a very price-competitive traffic sensing solution that can not only do the job of inductive loops better but offers many other functionalities like visual inspection, the ability to create an unlimited number of virtual inductive loops in a single camera view and can also detect as many as of 16 object classes.
flow is born with the capability for lpr and traffic violation detection and enforcement and much, much more.
knowing this, it is obvious why video analytics solutions such as flow are starting to make waves in the its world.
in this article, we provide a quick overview of the current state of the us market and showcase multiple projects of the flow video analytics devices deployment for various use cases including daily traffic operations, bicycle counting, adaptive traffic control and traffic data collection for planning and safety analysis.
videoanalytics setup in florida with gates gathering origin-destionation data the current status of us market traffic data gathering field what are the current views on video analytics using the new generation of traffic sensing and data processing technology?
to answer that we need to recall the past.
legacy technology for the past 30 years has driven much of definition of what is required for compatibility while limiting what is possible as a result.
for data collection, one legacy requirement of them is the approach to data storage.
until now, because of limited choices for communications options, these organizations required a full year of onboard data storage on the specific traffic monitoring edge device.
new iot technology has much better connectivity, allowing cities rapidly deploy devices and collect smart city data on updated aggregation platforms.
these faster, real-time connections help to reduce latency, improve the data download and availability, and reduce the need for long periods between login and retrieval as well as improved aggregation and display of information.
this new data management that relies less on local storage thanks to active data sending and server-side user pc data storage.
smart sensors can also be dual purpose.
the highly accurate flow analytics improve not only object detection in all types of weather, they provide non-embedded classification of both motor vehicles and expanded classes of active mobility road users.
traffic operations requirements to accurately provide detections to the controller come hand in hand with the improved ability to report a rich data set of the objects characteristics while it passes within a camera field of view.
in the case of flow video analytics edge devices, this means the real-time data is fed directly to traffic controllers via ntcip or open api via a network connection, in addition to classic sdlc or i 0 directly.
simultaneously, the long-term traffic counts and various other traffic statistics are continuously being updated on servers, smart city platforms, traffic control center devices, and other systems that require this data.
this happens thanks to the edge devices being directly connected to the citys network via ethernet, wifi, or lte .
example video analytics setup for gathering multimodal traffic data on cars, bicycles and pedestrians at the same time the trusted technology bias is another factor that was holding back the onslaught of video analytics solutions on the inductive loop, radar detection, or analog camera counterparts.
these technologies have been the only few trusted solutions for real-time traffic detection in the market for a long time.
this is no longer the case.
the video analytic detection capability coupled with the enhanced data set available overwhelmingly tipped decisions in favor of video-analytics-based solutions.
a flurry of solid arguments and a growing number of successful deployments of the new generation of video analytics technology has proven the cost-benefit of improved accuracy, reliability, ease of installation, verification, connection, and remote monitoring of individual sensor performance is provided along with , massively expanded data set that are bringing new insights from the roadside cabinet that was never available before.
long gone are the waiting for someone to call if the signal is not timed correctly complaint with intersection performance measures are now something that is a tool readily available based on smart sensors and smart city applications.
xroads unit installed inside a traffic cabinet analog to digital conversion of camera signal trafficxroads in the usa trafficxroads is one of the flagship devices running the flow video analytics system.
it is an embedded unit that can process up to 6 camera streams on the edge.
there are already completed installations in texas and virginia, and multiple pocs in progress across the usa.
this product has many benefits and is well suited for intersection detection, and traffic control input for daily operations coupled with traffic data collection as well as signal performance measures spm input for planners.
it is easy to do an initial proof of concept to reduce the time to installation and verification with trafficxroads as it can be usually done quite quickly using existing ip camera streams.
this reduces the delays associated with construction, road closure or other labor-intensive measures associated with testing a new system for approval.
many agencies take direct feeds from their video management systems vms remotely in tmc signal shop office space without the need to go to remote cabinets.
the trafficxroads can then be fully configured, tested, and verified prior to moving it to a field location for connection to a controller.
if data collection only is required, the same remote data feeds can be supplied to trafficxroads on a planners desk aggregated to 48-hour or 72-hour counts without interrupting operations to collect data.
the flow system on trafficxroads is also great for real-time 24 7 multimodal traffic for input into controllers and verification of bicycle lane usage at intersections.
it also allows nearly perfect adaptive traffic control with advanced conditioning such as lpr whitelisting of emergency vehicles or increasing safety by prolonging signal durations when pedestrians are still crossing.
the multimodality of the flow is seen as a massive benefit by many municipalities as time-based red-light running statistics, vulnerable road user conflicts and near misses can be detected, consolidated reports prepared, and acted upon before accidents happen helping with vision zero and safety analytics-based studies.
example dashboard with data for tracking tracking the effectiveness of adaptive traffic control with focus on the reduction of the number vehicles that need to stop at the intersection of course, turning movement counts and od matrix statistics are available for download as well.
for increased security, all operations can reside behind an agency firewall with no cloud access or off-premise connectivity required.
moreover, this solution is very, very price competitive.
this is because compared to rival solutions, flow offers a wide range of advanced features that they dont have while being the same or even lower price than the competition.
there are no required ongoing software as a service charges but additional version updates with new features can be purchased.
note that the client gets the most up-to-date major version upon installation and has free updates for the predetermined period achieving the desired real-time communication with flow devices is easy thanks to many options, including open api, sldc, webhooks, i o modules, and can communicate out of the box with nema ts-2 or ntcip standard-based traffic controllers.
rest and udp sinks can also be used to communicate with third-party data collection platforms.
additionally, there is a standard datafromsky flow insights user interface, whether you are using trafficxroads at the intersection, a stand-alone trafficcamera for a particular study, or the trafficenterprise server system analyzing hundreds of streams for its applications or smart city operations.the trafficenterprise server-side solution is well-suited for connecting large numbers of video streams of existing camera infrastructure.
it can be implemented quite easily to most vms platforms, especially when integrated with the milestone vms.
lastly, flow insights allows full configuration of any flow device to provide a wide range of data visualization options and widgets, allowing the creation of live dashboards or data feeds.
flow dashboard example with real-time traffic statistics data aggregated on the edge device flow video analytics is very versatile and easy to use.
site setup via an ever-improving visual programming language.
flow insights quickly provides users the ability to filter all the detected objects for reports, or trigger based on detected objects position or actions within the fov.
this enables everything from simple loop emulation at a stop line to more complicated scenarios such as u-turn detection, pedestrian cross-walk encroachment, blocking vehicle detection, queue detection, red light or stop sign violations, or average speed measuring in addition to simple count studies.
the highly optimized and fully configurable object trajectory processing engine evaluates dozens of detection tasks in each camera view in parallel, 24 7 365 accurately and reliably.
specialty expression and string widget even allow custom coding.
you are free to set up the detection and conditioning to track and detect exactly what you need in the way you need it.
if you do not see what you need, flow has the ability to add new ai object classes or performance upgrades if required as it is continually developing.

apart from that, we have evaluated the velocity measurement accuracy against our certified radars and the difference is basically zero.
brig.
gen. judr.
vclav kuera, phd., mba, director of the central bohemian police situation every year, tens of thousands of injuries occur during road accidents in the czech republic alone.
the most frequent causes of serious accidents, apart from speeding and failing to give way, are failures to keep safe headway.
tailgating, aggressive driving, problematic overtaking are very difficult to detect with existing police resources.
datafromsky brings a paradigm shift into this situation with its real-time traffic monitoring solution based on drones and artificial intelligence.
no-one knows where and when we are actually flying the trafficdrones, so the drivers do not adjust their behavior only on known measurement spots.
instead, they tend to drive safer all the time.
col. ing.
ondej smotlacha deputy director of the central bohemian police research during the last year, central bohemian police directorate have partnered with datafromsky to improve safety on roads in their jurisdiction.
first of all, extensive measurement campaign was performed more than 100 000 vehicles were captured from a drone and driving dynamics were then analyzed by trafficsurvey service.
more than 40 of the drivers were found to drive closer than the recommended 2 seconds behind the previous vehicle.
gap-time monitoring data presented in a graph source: central bohemian police directorate solution - trafficdrone the central bohemian police officers therefore came with a prevention project that features datafromsky trafficdrone technology as its core part.
diverse road sections are being re-visited by the police team to fly a drone and measure the drivers behavior with a focus on tailgating and aggressive driving.
another team is placed a few hundred meters down the road at the measurement location, at a place that is safe for stopping the trespassing vehicles.
drivers that were driving dangerously are confronted with the measurement results directly on spot and they are being offered to obtain the measurement protocol by e-mail.
trafficdrone processing unit being prepared for deployment drivers are then sharing this experience and thus creating public awareness of the drone-based traffic monitoring.
combined with the substantial pr efforts of central bohemian police directorate the drone measurement campaign has been featured numerous times in the main czechtv news, specialized and popular magazines and on-line media this project has a real chance to improve driver behavior and therefore increase safety on czech roads.
location central bohemia, czech republic about the customer central bohemian police directorate is a pioneer in drone deployment among czech law enforcement agencies.
it uses drones for accident documentation and investigation, missing person search missions, patrolling and other use cases.
it runs its own unmanned flight academy, operates a fleet of more than 20 drones and employs more than 100 certified drone pilots.
highlights tailgating and aggressive driving are being measured from a drone and the results are presented to the drivers directly on the spot a pioneering approach enabled by the trafficdrone technology approaching drivers directly after they have been driving dangerously has a profound educational effect and helps them to relate to the situation better.
preventive form of this campaign no fines are being issued contributes to positive perception of this campaign among the driver community.
4. on-street parking based on collaborative camera environment with anpr the goal of this project is to provide the same functionality as is common in indoor parking lots for on-street parking i.e.
real-time measuring of the current occupancy of parking lot including the detailed information about the parked vehicles.
the vehicle detail has to contain the number plate, type, and color.
standard approach in solving this task is to deploy a huge amount of anpr cameras which have to be installed very close to the monitored area to ensure that in each camera view the number plate is clearly visible and recognizable.
the typical ratio is 6 parking spots per camera.
this approach is economically infeasible for outdoor parking where the detailed info about each parked vehicle is mandatory.
our solution is much smarter.
it is based on the unique features of flow, the ability to track an object across cameras thanks to advanced tracking algorithms and re-identification techniques.
to cover 40 parking spaces, we used only 3 cameras, one for anpr at the entrance and two as surveillance cameras see the picture below .
our solution brings an extreme level of parking information for advanced parking policies at a minimal price.

to be able to extract the above-mentioned information, video from the aerial perspective needed to be shot.
the aerial view always provides more accurate data about the exact position of the object, its speed or acceleration, and other connected features.
in this study, video from 20 different roundabouts have been used.
this step was followed by the process of stabilization, georeferencing, and analysis of objects and their trajectories within the video.
the last step was processing the georeferenced video over the datafromsky viewer that provides visualization of results, setting different parameters, and the possibility to export data out of the video.

the study, created by the connecticut metropolitan council of governments metrocog and fhi, identify strategies to create a safe and attractive pedestrian environment, a robust infrastructure for bicyclists, and linkages between residential areas and the shops, businesses and restaurants along black rock turnpike.
black rock turnpike is a major arterial that serves one of the citys largest business and commercial districts.
according to the estimates, approximately 20,000 vehicles utilize this corridor every day.
as the results of the analysis show although black rock turnpike has a posted speed limit of 50 km h 30 miles h , the average speeds are between 55 65 km h 35-40 miles h .
the road widths, speed, high traffic volume and numerous curb cuts create an unsafe and uninviting pedestrian environment.

however, what is truly remarkable about this analysis is the method how the data were recorded and analyzed.
to be able to cover the whole corridor, which is roughly 1,3 km 0,8 miles in length, up to 8 drones recording at the same time were needed!
this allowed us to analyze the corridor as a complex scene, obtain the complete trajectories of vehicles for the whole analyzed route and create the detailed origin-destination statistics!

the analysis covers the junction between the leopold ii lane and sainctelette - one of the biggest and most complex junctions in brussel.
in this case, the video is made by a tethered drone to get a longer survey.
thanks to datafromsky, it is possible to create a detailed traffic study which was handled to the government of brussel and its mobility department, providing the correct data for creating solutions that can improve the traffic flow and safety of this junction.

it can be difficult to get an overview of the whole situation and define the hot spots where the traffic behavior is simply non-standard.
our tool data from sky is in most cases be able to uncover, sort and analyze all movements of vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians in a larger area and evaluate critical parts of a road network, that might be risky for any traffic participant.
this kind of overview and analysis can give traffic and urban planners a very good starting point for designing any adjustments.
the figure shows an area in the city of aarhus in denmark and displays the flow of cyclists pink trajectories and pedestrians green trajectories in the 2-hour period.
the main goal of the analysis is to provide the aarhus municipality with an overview of cyclists and pedestrian movement in the analyzed area and identify some patterns in their traffic behavior.
after having formed a detailed overview of all the different flows and routes, the traffic study is focusing on those areas, where cyclists and pedestrians behavior gets into a collision.
the detailed datafromsky analysis helped to analyze the problematic spots and draw up proposals for changes, that can help to simplify the traffic flow.
aarhus municipality will evaluate the list of proposals and test them on the site by making temporary changes and observing whether they have the intended effect before the changes are implemented permanently.

the original occupancy monitoring system was built on camera detection on entry exit points to the parking lot.
this approach appeared to the municipality as not working well due to the lack of accuracy.
the original system had detection accuracy of 90 , which is an industry standard.
however, statistically speaking, each 10th vehicle was not detected either entering or exiting.
on an average daily parking rate of 500 vehicles, this brings an inaccuracy of 50 vehicles per day.
the inaccuracy remains in the system and accumulates further to 1500 errors per month.
this was not acceptable, so the municipality needed a replacement.
with the parkingdetection system we deployed a completely different approach.
by installing additional 13 cameras to cover the whole parking lot, the system was able to identify occupancy of each parking bay.
this significantly increased accuracy of the occupancy detection.
even in case any inaccuracy occurred, the system automatically corrects itself as the whole area is completely covered with cameras.
plnek foto 2 illustration: camera position design of 155 parking bays by using 18 cameras on 9 light poles another challenge in the parking lot was unstable power supply.
this was solved by using battery packs installed on each of the 9 poles to power supply cameras during the day as the night power was provided from the light poles.
during the night time batteries were re-charged to again provide enough power in the daytime.
in this way the system is fully functional 24 7 even without constant power supply on the spot.
illustration: live camera feed showing the occupancy in the camera images zbr z kamer v2 the camera images are processed on a local parkingdetection dnn gateway containing an image processor.
with this approach the solution is fully gdpr compliant as no images are leaving the site, only processed data via lte.
thanks to that there is a low requirement on the data transmission via the internet, which saves monthly costs on the sim connectivity.
the processed data are collected on the smart city platform to have a complete picture of the city in a centralized system.
from here is then individual parking lot occupancy shared over dozens of led panels across the city to make parking easier for citizens and visitors.

in order to improve the traffic flow through the roundabout, the city of ulm needed to have more details about it.
it was important to understand how long the traffic jams are and when they are created times of days, days of week, days of month, influence of holidays, etc.
.
for this reason, there was a strong need for continuous data collection instead of a single traffic analysis.
additional challenge was the location chosen by the municipality as the requirement stated to monitor a complete 400m corridor on an incoming arm to the roundabout.
this was required to understand the actual length of the congestion and the level of traffic through the whole area.
illustration: design of the area coverage using 8 cameras on 4 lights poles ulm installation the deployed solutions consisted of 4 sections, each monitoring approximately 100m area.
in the middle of each section was a light post, where 2 cameras were installed.
image processing from those cameras was conducted on an edge processor trafficembedded unit deployed on each of the lamp posts.
this local processing complied with a strong gdpr requirement as no images are shared from the location, only fully processed data.
a wifi connection was in between each of the trafficembedded units and the processed data were transmitted through the internet via one unit with lte modem installed.
with this approach were saved monthly costs on the data plan as only a single sim card was required.
illustration: screenshot from the camera demonstrating the set-up in the ui with anonymization enabled.
in the image you can see one of the spatial filter zones that monitors the traffic, measures passage time through the zone and based on the speeds of cars in the different zones the system determines the length of the traffic jam.
ulm2 traffic data such as flow rate and length of the traffic jam were later transmitted using rst apis to a local smart city platform to aggregate the data centrally.
the evaluation of exact vehicle traces extracted from the video streams is done by flow framework running on the trafficembedded units.
the units were remotely set up to measure traffic intensity, calculate the level of service, and provide the information about the length of traffic jams.
all of this in real-time to allow immediate responses to the current traffic situation.
flow insights offers a range of data visualization options to choose from including simple values, statistical values, time and distribution based graphs, od matrices, heatmaps and gridmaps.
for getting the correct level of service the flow filtered out all single track vehicles using the category filter.
level of service is then calculated from the objects that have already passed through the zone.
using the time block settings the data output is the average of the last 5 minutes.
flow scripting feature was used for the optimization of measuring the length of the column by a traffic expert.
thanks to this unique function flow provided the optimal solution for pinpointing the length of the columns as well as evaluating the changes of traffic flow in the monitored road segment.
the traffic data and events detected by flow framework are automatically sent to a smart-city platform invipo via a secured rest api.
this platform stores all data and offers detailed historical statistics and exports, which the operator can then use to improve the traffic situation in the city.

________________ 2. parking occupancy monitoring on a train station in denmark the municipality of kge, denmark constructed a regionally significant train station for commuters.
a thousand of passengers use kge nord train station daily for either commuting or a simple traveling to the capital of copenhagen.
majority of commuters used cars to get to the train station and then switched to the train to finish the commute to the capital.
this required building a parking lot with 650 parking spaces.
on top of that, the requirement was to monitor the area to provide real-time occupancy for smoother and faster parking and traveling.
the requirement was to use cameras for this task as individual ground sensors would become ineffective for 650 parking spots on the outside.
a camera-based system is able to cover multiple parking bays at once and is non-intrusive to the parkings surface.
illustration: multisensory camera installed on a pole image for the actual installation were used 25 cameras across 2 large parking areas.
each camera was installed on an individual pole or a lamp post in height ranging between 8-10m.
these cameras have a dual use parking occupancy and security.
a constant power supply was provided by the system integrator as well as the network connectivity.
images are further collected and processed on a central server, where the occupancy analysis is constantly performed in real-time.
illustration: scheme of 2 parking areas covered at kge nord with 650 parking bays dsb kge nord station - scanview the analyzed data are then used on led panels around the parking lot as well as within the kge city and nearby motorway.
this helps drivers to optimize their route and avoid creating traffic congestions.

complex od matrix of the urban area of the town of conegliano situation due to its outdated urban traffic plan and growing tourist popularity of the town of conegliano, a need for a new traffic plan arose.
the research team aimed to create a plan for both urban traffic and active mobility as well as a basis for design of new road infrastructure paths for cyclists and pedestrians.
moreover, the plan was to be focused on improving traffic safety in the area, reducing speeds and providing insights for possible redesign of problematic intersections.
detailed overview of the traffic situation also should have served as a foundation for air pollution reduction measures .
conducting the research first step was to determine which traffic arteries to focus on.
the ones selected were then monitored by several means: traffic radars, traffic cameras drones.
to get even deeper insights, the researchers asked chosen drivers to fill in a questionnaire about their travelling habits.
apart from the information about traffic flow, measured mainly with traffic radars during rush hours, the scientists also collected information from the drivers on their way throughout the city with the help of local police.
the questions revolved around frequency of travelling, motivation for the travel, planned stops and parking intentions next step was rather ambitious - the intention was to create a full scope overview of the city traffic within a chosen time window.
to achieve that, the researchers decided to utilize the ai-powered detection by datafromsky - namely trafficsurvey light service and its custom license plate detection feature along with the data from the drones analyzed by trafficsurvey aerial tool.
combining the two sources together, the researchers were able to create an od matrix of the entire area along with tmc, which allowed them to understand the full scope of the traffic situation in the town.
the gathered data were further used for traffic simulation in ptv vissim and a creation of possible future scenarios.
results: one of the main outcomes of the research was a set of recommendations for the further steps of the traffic planning process.
the researchers proposals addressed the need for reducing congestions in several areas and a major local roundabout as well as the need for new traffic light calibration at certain intersections.
other traffic flow improvements were proposed, too, e. g. suggestions to implement new one way streets or regulate traffic around schools.
secondly, new safety improvements were suggested: adding more pedestrian protection features in a handful of streets with high road crossing volumes speed reduction in densely populated areas.
and finally, a few requests about parking, cyclist safety and public transport organizations were made wrapping up the complex study.
trondheim, norway location city of trondheim integrator cowi a s due to the introduction of the metro bus system in trondheim, norway, four of the main streets leading into and through the city center will be redesigned.
elgeseter gate, which is the main road to the city center from the south, is one of these streets.
22 000 vehicles drive through the street every day and approximately 100 buses pass in each direction in the peak hour.
the street gives access to the university hospital as well as the university in trondheim, offices and residences.
our datafromsky partner - cowi as is making a zoning plan for the street, and will do analysis of different design alternatives, using the traffic data from datafromsky in order to get exact knowledge about traffic flows, both cars, pedestrians and bicycles.

aarhus, denmark location city of aarhus integrator cowi a s in many cities, there are places where many road users pass or stay in a complicated network of routes and get into a risky interaction.
it can be difficult to get an overview of the whole situation and define the hot spots where the traffic behavior is simply non-standard.
our tool data from sky is in most cases able to uncover, sort and analyze all movements of vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians in a larger area and evaluate critical parts of a road network that might be risky for any traffic participant.
this kind of overview and analysis can give traffic and urban planners a very good starting point for designing any adjustments.
the figure shows an area in the city of aarhus in denmark and displays the flow of cyclists pink trajectories and pedestrians green trajectories in the 2-hour period.
the main goal of the analysis is to provide the aarhus municipality with an overview of cyclists and pedestrian movement in the analyzed area and identify some patterns in their traffic behavior.
after having formed a detailed overview of all the different flows and routes, the traffic study is focusing on those areas, where cyclists and pedestrians behavior gets into a collision.
the detailed datafromsky analysis helped to analyze the problematic spots and draw up proposals for changes, that can help to simplify the traffic flow.
aarhus municipality will evaluate the list of proposals and test them on the site by making temporary changes and observing whether they have the intended effect before the changes are implemented permanently.
________________ winterswijk - gelderland, netherlands location gelderland province department of transportation integrator roelofs traffic flow trajectories: green cars, yellow heavy vehicles, red bicycles, blue pedestrians roelofs, partner of datafromsky in the netherlands, carried out comprehensive traffic research of a traffic node in the province of gelderland.
the data collected with a drone and analyzed by datafromsky aerial platform will be used as the main source for a study for planned major maintenance in 2021. the drone was deployed at the roundabout of the n318 misterweg in winterswijk.
when preparing for the major maintenance of this road, it is also being examined whether road safety can be improved.
besides other things, datafromsky offers many great features for analysis of traffic behavior and road safety, including analysis of risky situations or near collisions, calculation of time to collision, heavy breaking and analysis of many other factors.
for many years, the data were collected by people standing on the side and observing the traffic, then the data were evaluated manually.
this process was lengthy, inefficient, and had low-precision data output.
all of these shortcomings are overtaken with a new modern approach combining 2 great technologies of today world: drones and ai.
________________ redesigning the ring road of leeuwarden - 8 drones and traffic survey of 1km long road the city council of leeuwarden, netherlands, was concerned about the traffic flow on the local arterial road - the city beltway.
for this reason, they asked our partner roelofs to conduct a traffic study of the city ring and its problematic areas.
roelofs decided to use an unprecedented approach to the analysis - spatial merging of the footage gathered using 8 drones for complete trajectories from 1,2km long road, that was then analyzed with datafromsky trafficsurvey service.
this has produced very impressive results that would not otherwise be possible with manual counting or static cameras.
project highlights large-scale analysis keeping an eye on cyclists data-driven decisions to get most accurate results, roelofs opted to combine data from multiple drones simultaneously flying over 1,2km long road.
thanks to advanced dfs tools, the data were merged into a single analysis.
use of video analysis ensured rich insight about both cars and cyclists, who were posing a major challenge on the roads.
thanks to the results provided by dfs and roelofs, the city decided to rebuild problematic road sections to prevent further traffic jams.
situation the road ring of leeuwarden mostly consists of 2x2 lanes.
however, there was a problematic area consisting merely of a 1x1 road, a narrow bridge and several roundabouts.
that particular section of the beltway was suffering from constant traffic jam problems, which the council wanted to get resolved by 2030. and that very section became the centrepoint of roelofs' analysis.
leeuwarden is a municipality located in friesland, netherlands.
with more than 100 000 inhabitants and population density of 516 km2, the local traffic situation is becoming a challenge.
mastering the drones to get the big picture of the situation, roelofs decided to conduct a unique, large-scale aerial analysis using 8 recording drones in total.
four crucial areas of interest were pinpointed: a bridge, two roundabouts and a central section, marking a kilometer-long area to be covered simultaneously.
due to limited drone battery capacity, each area was covered by a pair of devices.
the recording was conducted twice, during morning and evening rush hours.
the gathered data were further analyzed with datafromsky trafficsurvey service, providing roelofs with merged accurate trajectory data about both cars and cyclists from the recorded videos.
apart from detailed trajectories, roelofs received a wide variety of data about each road users category, speed and gap times, allowing them to understand the traffic situation in depth.
subsequently, roelofs used the data to analyze the traffic density during different daytimes to create an o d matrix of the area.
finally, thanks to trafficsurvey viewers heatmap feature, roelofs could also easily visualize the gathered information and present it to the client in a comprehensible way.
results the data were later processed in vissim software to simulate the traffic flow in several possible future scenarios, assessing the redesign options for the ring road and their impact see how to use our data for simulation in vissim .
thanks to the rich data output from dfs trafficsurvey, roelofs could conduct an accurate simulation and identify the bottlenecks in the examined area.
furthermore, they revealed other potential issues, such as crossing with cyclists, which were always problematic to point out using non-video approaches.
the client was impressed with the results as they clarified the situation and provided him with enough data to justify the investment to make a data-driven decision.
consequently, the city decided to rebuild the beltway, add additional road lanes in the problematic section and also address the issues with the bridge and the cyclist crossing to improve the driving experience and prevent delays during rush hours.

massachusetts dot department of transportation wanted to monitor traffic on a bridge and wanted to compare different types of traffic lane distributions testing the changing of 2 out of 4 car lanes into bicycle lanes and see how this will affect their usage.
the installation had to be done on bridge decks meaning there are no locations to place embedded sensors without compromising the longevity of the bridge.
due to this, non-embedded sensors from existing lighting poles were seen as the best option.
after an industry survey conducted by the department, smartek its won the screening process with datafromskys flow, namely the trafficcamera with onboard video analytics.
flow video analytics allowed simultaneous real-time reporting and data collection enabled during the projects bridge monitoring program by vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian detection as the change of traffic schemes progressed.
as vehicle travel lanes morphed into dedicated bicycle lanes, the sensor technology did not miss a beat given flows built-in 17 object classification categories.
the 4 general traffic lanes were converted to 2 for bicycles and 2 for cars.
as lanes were re-drawn, no changes to the flow traffic monitoring scheme had to be done with the flows ai classification availability and virtual loop placement for continuous and flexible classification and directional discrimination of all bridge users.
the mdot appreciated using the same sensor work zone and project monitoring transitioning into permanent sensor usage for smart city applications without re-location or re-calibration are huge installation and maintenance benefits that convinced them to choose flow video analytics.
